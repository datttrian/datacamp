    "**Course Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing your own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User-defined functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype,\n",
    "**strings**. Recall that these represent textual data. To assign the\n",
    "string `'DataCamp'` to a variable `company`, you execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "    company = 'DataCamp'\n",
    "\n",
    "You've also learned to use the operations `+` and `*` with strings.\n",
    "Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the `+` operator\n",
    "*concatenates* strings together, while the `*` concatenates multiple\n",
    "copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the `+` and\n",
    "`*` operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the\n",
    "following code in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "    object1 = \"data\" + \"analysis\" + \"visualization\"\n",
    "    object2 = 1 * 3\n",
    "    object3 = \"1\" * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the values in `object1`, `object2`, and `object3`,\n",
    "respectively?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] `object1` contains `\"data + analysis + visualization\"`, `object2`\n",
    "    contains `\"1*3\"`, `object3` contains `13`.\n",
    "- [ ] `object1` contains `\"data+analysis+visualization\"`, `object2`\n",
    "    contains `3`, `object3` contains `\"13\"`.\n",
    "- [x] `object1` contains `\"dataanalysisvisualization\"`, `object2` contains\n",
    "    `3`, `object3` contains `\"111\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recapping built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in\n",
    "functions `print()` and `str()`. Here, you will use both functions and\n",
    "examine their return values. A variable `x` has been preloaded for this\n",
    "exercise. Run the code below in the console. Pay close attention to the\n",
    "results to answer the question that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Assign `str(x)` to a variable `y1`: `y1 = str(x)`\n",
    "-   Assign `print(x)` to a variable `y2`: `y2 = print(x)`\n",
    "-   Check the types of the variables `x`, `y1`, and `y2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the types of `x`, `y1`, and `y2`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] They are all `str` types.\n",
    "- [ ] `x` is a `float`, `y1` is an `float`, and `y2` is a `str`.\n",
    "- [x] `x` is a `float`, `y1` is a `str`, and `y2` is a `NoneType`.\n",
    "- [ ] They are all `NoneType` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write a simple function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last video, Hugo described the basics of how to define a\n",
    "function. You will now write your own function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function, `shout()`, which simply prints out a string with\n",
    "three exclamation marks `'!!!'` at the end. The code for the `square()`\n",
    "function that we wrote earlier is found below. You can use it as a\n",
    "pattern to define `shout()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def square():\n",
    "        new_value = 4 ** 2\n",
    "        return new_value\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the function body is indented 4 spaces already for you.\n",
    "Function bodies need to be indented by a consistent number of spaces and\n",
    "the choice of 4 is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if\n",
    "you ever need a quick refresher, download the [Python for Data Science\n",

    "### What you’ve learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now able to write functions in Python that accept single and multiple arguments and can return as many values as you please. You're also adept at using default and flexible arguments and keyword arguments. You've gained insight into scoping in Python, can write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. You've also gained invaluable practice in using all of these techniques to write functions that are useful in a Data Science context. You have come a long way in your developing practice as a budding Pythonista Data Scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There’s more to learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more basic skills that you will need to learn in Python to be valuable as a working Data Scientist and many of these we'll cover in the sequel to this course so if you're finding yourself still thirsty for more Pythonista Data Science chops, I'd head over there right now. There you'll learn all about list comprehensions, which allow you to wrangle data in lists to create other lists, a tool utilized by all Data Scientists working in Python. You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. Iterators are everywhere in PythonLand and, to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate Data Science protocols and procedures over sets of objects; these are a couple of the cool functionalities in PythonLand you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both of these courses.\n",
