**Course Description**

It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.

# Writing your own functions

In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

## User-defined functions

### Strings in Python

In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype,
**strings**. Recall that these represent textual data. To assign the
string `'DataCamp'` to a variable `company`, you execute:

    company = 'DataCamp'

You've also learned to use the operations `+` and `*` with strings.
Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the `+` operator
*concatenates* strings together, while the `*` concatenates multiple
copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the `+` and
`*` operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the
following code in the shell:

    object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
    object2 = 1 * 3
    object3 = "1" * 3

What are the values in `object1`, `object2`, and `object3`,
respectively?

- [ ] `object1` contains `"data + analysis + visualization"`, `object2`
    contains `"1*3"`, `object3` contains `13`.
- [ ] `object1` contains `"data+analysis+visualization"`, `object2`
    contains `3`, `object3` contains `"13"`.
- [x] `object1` contains `"dataanalysisvisualization"`, `object2` contains
    `3`, `object3` contains `"111"`.

### Recapping built-in functions

In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in
functions `print()` and `str()`. Here, you will use both functions and
examine their return values. A variable `x` has been preloaded for this
exercise. Run the code below in the console. Pay close attention to the
results to answer the question that follows.

-   Assign `str(x)` to a variable `y1`: `y1 = str(x)`
-   Assign `print(x)` to a variable `y2`: `y2 = print(x)`
-   Check the types of the variables `x`, `y1`, and `y2`.

What are the types of `x`, `y1`, and `y2`?

- [ ] They are all `str` types.
- [ ] `x` is a `float`, `y1` is an `float`, and `y2` is a `str`.
- [x] `x` is a `float`, `y1` is a `str`, and `y2` is a `NoneType`.
- [ ] They are all `NoneType` types.

### Write a simple function

In the last video, Hugo described the basics of how to define a
function. You will now write your own function!

Define a function, `shout()`, which simply prints out a string with
three exclamation marks `'!!!'` at the end. The code for the `square()`
function that we wrote earlier is found below. You can use it as a
pattern to define `shout()`.

    def square():
        new_value = 4 ** 2
        return new_value

Note that the function body is indented 4 spaces already for you.
Function bodies need to be indented by a consistent number of spaces and
the choice of 4 is common.

*This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if
you ever need a quick refresher, download the [Python for Data Science
Cheat
Sheet](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/0eff0330-e87d-4c34-88d5-73e80cb955f2)
and keep it handy!*

-   Complete the function header by adding the appropriate function
    name, `shout`.
-   In the function body, **concatenate** the string,
    `'congratulations'` with another string, `'!!!'`. Assign the result
    to `shout_word`.
-   Print the value of `shout_word`.
-   Call the `shout` function.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define the function shout
def shout():
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = 'congratulations' + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout
shout()
```

### Single-parameter functions

Congratulations! You have successfully defined *and* called your own
function! That's pretty cool.

In the previous exercise, you defined and called the function `shout()`,
which printed out a string concatenated with `'!!!'`. You will now
update `shout()` by adding a *parameter* so that it can accept and
process any string *argument* passed to it. Also note that
`shout(word)`, the part of the *header* that specifies the function name
and parameter(s), is known as the *signature* of the function. You may
encounter this term in the wild!

-   Complete the function header by adding the parameter name, `word`.
-   Assign the result of concatenating `word` with `'!!!'` to
    `shout_word`.
-   Print the value of `shout_word`.
-   Call the `shout()` function, passing to it the string,
    `'congratulations'`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Print a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Print shout_word
    print(shout_word)

# Call shout with the string 'congratulations'
shout('congratulations')
```

### Functions that return single values

You're getting very good at this! Try your hand at another modification
to the `shout()` function so that it now *returns* a single value
instead of printing within the function. Recall that the `return`
keyword lets you return values from functions. Parts of the function
`shout()`, which you wrote earlier, are shown. Returning values is
generally more desirable than printing them out because, as you saw
earlier, a `print()` call assigned to a variable has type `NoneType`.

-   In the function body, concatenate the string in `word` with `'!!!'`
    and assign to `shout_word`.
-   Replace the `print()` statement with the appropriate `return`
    statement.
-   Call the `shout()` function, passing to it the string,
    `'congratulations'`, and assigning the call to the variable, `yell`.
-   To check if `yell` contains the value returned by `shout()`, print
    the value of `yell`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Return a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Replace print with return
    return shout_word

# Pass 'congratulations' to shout: yell
yell = shout('congratulations')

# Print yell
print(yell)
```

## Multiple parameters and return values

### Functions with multiple parameters

Hugo discussed the use of multiple parameters in defining functions in
the last lecture. You are now going to use what you've learned to modify
the `shout()` function further. Here, you will modify `shout()` to
accept two arguments. Parts of the function `shout()`, which you wrote
earlier, are shown.

-   Modify the function header such that it accepts two parameters,
    `word1` and `word2`, in that order.
-   Concatenate each of `word1` and `word2` with `'!!!'` and assign to
    `shout1` and `shout2`, respectively.
-   Concatenate `shout1` and `shout2` together, in that order, and
    assign to `new_shout`.
-   Pass the strings `'congratulations'` and `'you'`, in that order, to
    a call to `shout()`. Assign the return value to `yell`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout with parameters word1 and word2
def shout(word1, word2):
    """Concatenate strings with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate shout1 with shout2: new_shout
    new_shout = shout1 + shout2

    # Return new_shout
    return new_shout

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout: yell
yell = shout('congratulations', 'you')

# Print yell
print(yell)
```

### A brief introduction to tuples

Alongside learning about functions, you've also learned about tuples!
Here, you will practice what you've learned about tuples: how to
construct, unpack, and access tuple elements. Recall how Hugo unpacked
the tuple `even_nums` in the video:

`a, b, c = even_nums`

A three-element tuple named `nums` has been preloaded for this exercise.
Before completing the script, perform the following:

-   Print out the value of `nums` in the IPython shell. Note the
    elements in the tuple.
-   In the IPython shell, try to change the first element of `nums` to
    the value *2* by doing an assignment: `nums[0] = 2`. What happens?

<!-- -->

-   Unpack `nums` to the variables `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
-   Construct a new tuple, `even_nums` composed of the same elements in
    `nums`, but with the 1st element replaced with the value, *2*.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
nums = (3,4,6)

# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3
num1, num2, num3 = nums

# Construct even_nums
even_nums = (2, num2, num3)
```

### Functions that return multiple values

In the previous exercise, you constructed tuples, assigned tuples to
variables, and unpacked tuples. Here you will return multiple values
from a function using tuples. Let's now update our `shout()` function to
return multiple values. Instead of returning just one string, we will
return two strings with the string `!!!` concatenated to each.

Note that the return statement `return x, y` has the same result as
`return (x, y)`: the former actually packs `x` and `y` into a tuple
under the hood!

-   Modify the function header such that the function name is now
    `shout_all`, and it accepts two parameters, `word1` and `word2`, in
    that order.
-   Concatenate the string `'!!!'` to each of `word1` and `word2` and
    assign to `shout1` and `shout2`, respectively.
-   Construct a tuple `shout_words`, composed of `shout1` and `shout2`.
-   Call `shout_all()` with the strings `'congratulations'` and `'you'`
    and assign the result to `yell1` and `yell2` (remember,
    `shout_all()` returns 2 variables!).

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout_all with parameters word1 and word2
def shout_all(word1, word2):
    """Return a tuple of strings"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Construct a tuple with shout1 and shout2: shout_words
    shout_words = (shout1, shout2)

    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout_all(): yell1, yell2
yell1, yell2 = shout_all('congratulations', 'you')

# Print yell1 and yell2
print(yell1)
print(yell2)
```

## Bringing it all together

### Bringing it all together (1)

You've got your first taste of writing your own functions in the
previous exercises. You've learned how to add parameters to your own
function definitions, return a value or multiple values with tuples, and
how to call the functions you've defined.

In this and the following exercise, you will bring together all these
concepts and apply them to a simple data science problem. You will load
a dataset and develop functionalities to extract simple insights from
the data.

For this exercise, your goal is to recall how to load a dataset into a
DataFrame. The dataset contains Twitter data and you will iterate over
entries in a column to build a dictionary in which the keys are the
names of languages and the values are the number of tweets in the given
language. The file `tweets.csv` is available in your current directory.

*Be aware that this is real data from Twitter and as such there is
always a risk that it may contain profanity or other offensive content
(in this exercise, and any following exercises that also use real
Twitter data).*

-   Import the pandas package with the alias `pd`.
-   Import the file `'tweets.csv'` using the pandas function
    `read_csv()`. Assign the resulting DataFrame to `df`.
-   Complete the `for` loop by iterating over `col`, the `'lang'` column
    in the DataFrame `df`.
-   Complete the bodies of the `if-else` statements in the for loop:
    **if** the key is in the dictionary `langs_count`, add `1` to the
    value corresponding to this key in the dictionary, **else** add the
    key to `langs_count` and set the corresponding value to `1`. Use the
    loop variable `entry` in your code.

```{python, eval=F}
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')

# Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
langs_count = {}

# Extract column from DataFrame: col
col = df['lang']

# Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
for entry in col:

    # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
    if entry in langs_count.keys():
        langs_count[entry] += 1
    # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
    else:
        langs_count[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)
```

### Bringing it all together (2)

Great job! You've now defined the functionality for iterating over
entries in a column and building a dictionary with keys the names of
languages and values the number of tweets in the given language.

In this exercise, you will define a function with the functionality you
developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from
within the function, and call the function with the appropriate
arguments.

For your convenience, the pandas package has been imported as `pd` and
the `'tweets.csv'` file has been imported into the `tweets_df` variable.

-   Define the function `count_entries()`, which has two parameters. The
    first parameter is `df` for the DataFrame and the second is
    `col_name` for the column name.
-   Complete the bodies of the `if-else` statements in the `for` loop:
    **if** the key is in the dictionary `langs_count`, add `1` to its
    current value, **else** add the key to `langs_count` and set its
    value to `1`. Use the loop variable `entry` in your code.
-   Return the `langs_count` dictionary from inside the
    `count_entries()` function.
-   Call the `count_entries()` function by passing to it `tweets_df` and
    the name of the column, `'lang'`. Assign the result of the call to
    the variable `result`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
tweets_df = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')


# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]

    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry] += 1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count

# Call count_entries(): result
result = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Congratulations!

### Congratulations!

Congratulations, you're now a bonafide Python function writer. On top of that, you have just written your very first Data Sciencey function.

### Next chapters:

At this point, although you can write basic functions, you've really just touched the surface of function writing capabilities. In the following Chapters, you'll learn how to write functions that have default arguments so that when you call them, you don't always have to specify all the parameters; you'll learn how to write functions that can accept an arbitrary number of parameters and how to nest functions within one another; on top of this, you'll learn how to handle errors when writing functions, which will make your functions as robust as they need to be. Moreover, you'll see the importance of such techniques in Data Science by writing functions that are pertinent to the Data Science sphere like the Twitter DataFrame analysis that you just performed.

### Let's practice!

I am pumped for this and can't wait to see you in the next chapter!

# Default arguments, variable-length arguments and scope

In this chapter, you'll learn to write functions with default arguments so that the user doesn't always need to specify them, and variable-length arguments so they can pass an arbitrary number of arguments on to your functions. You'll also learn about the essential concept of scope.

## Scope and user-defined functions

### Pop quiz on understanding scope

In this exercise, you will practice what you've learned about scope in
functions. The variable `num` has been predefined as `5`, alongside the
following function definitions:

    def func1():
        num = 3
        print(num)

    def func2():
        global num
        double_num = num * 2
        num = 6
        print(double_num)

Try calling `func1()` and `func2()` in the shell, then answer the
following questions:

-   What are the values printed out when you call `func1()` and
    `func2()`?
-   What is the value of `num` in the global scope after calling
    `func1()` and `func2()`?

- [ ] `func1()` prints out `3`, `func2()` prints out `6`, and the value of
    `num` in the global scope is `3`.
- [ ] `func1()` prints out `3`, `func2()` prints out `3`, and the value of
    `num` in the global scope is `3`.
- [ ] `func1()` prints out `3`, `func2()` prints out `10`, and the value
    of `num` in the global scope is `10`.
- [x] `func1()` prints out `3`, `func2()` prints out `10`, and the value
    of `num` in the global scope is `6`.

### The keyword global

Let's work more on your mastery of scope. In this exercise, you will use
the keyword `global` within a function to alter the value of a variable
defined in the global scope.

-   Use the keyword `global` to alter the object `team` in the global
    scope.
-   Change the value of `team` in the global scope to the string
    `"justice league"`. Assign the result to `team`.
-   Hit the Submit button to see how executing your newly defined
    function `change_team()` changes the value of the name `team`!

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a string: team
team = "teen titans"

# Define change_team()
def change_team():
    """Change the value of the global variable team."""

    # Use team in global scope
    global team

    # Change the value of team in global: team
    team = "justice league"

# Print team
print(team)

# Call change_team()
change_team()

# Print team
print(team)
```

### Python's built-in scope

Here you're going to check out Python's built-in scope, which is really
just a built-in module called `builtins`. However, to query `builtins`,
you'll need to `import builtins` 'because the name builtins is not
itself built in…No, I’m serious!' ([*Learning Python*, 5th
edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do), Mark Lutz).
After executing `import builtins` in the IPython Shell, execute
`dir(builtins)` to print a list of all the names in the module
`builtins`. Have a look and you'll see a bunch of names that you'll
recognize! Which of the following names is NOT in the module builtins?

- [ ] 'sum'
- [ ] 'range'
- [x] 'array'
- [ ] 'tuple'

## Nested functions

### Nested Functions I

You've learned in the last video about nesting functions within
functions. One reason why you'd like to do this is to avoid writing out
the same computations within functions repeatedly. There's nothing new
about defining nested functions: you simply define it as you would a
regular function with `def` and embed it inside another function!

In this exercise, inside a function `three_shouts()`, you will define a
nested function `inner()` that concatenates a string object with `!!!`.
`three_shouts()` then returns a tuple of three elements, each a string
concatenated with `!!!` using `inner()`. Go for it!

-   Complete the function header of the nested function with the
    function name `inner()` and a single parameter `word`.
-   Complete the return value: each element of the tuple should be a
    call to `inner()`, passing in the parameters from `three_shouts()`
    as arguments to each call.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define three_shouts
def three_shouts(word1, word2, word3):
    """Returns a tuple of strings
    concatenated with '!!!'."""

    # Define inner
    def inner(word):
        """Returns a string concatenated with '!!!'."""
        return word + '!!!'

    # Return a tuple of strings
    return (inner(word1), inner(word2), inner(word3))

# Call three_shouts() and print
print(three_shouts('a', 'b', 'c'))
```

### Nested Functions II

Great job, you've just nested a function within another function. One
other pretty cool reason for nesting functions is the idea of a
**closure**. This means that the nested or inner function remembers the
state of its enclosing scope when called. Thus, anything defined locally
in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the
outer function has finished execution.

Let's move forward then! In this exercise, you will complete the
definition of the inner function `inner_echo()` and then call `echo()` a
couple of times, each with a different argument. Complete the exercise
and see what the output will be!

-   Complete the function header of the inner function with the function
    name `inner_echo()` and a single parameter `word1`.
-   Complete the function `echo()` so that it returns `inner_echo`.
-   We have called `echo()`, passing 2 as an argument, and assigned the
    resulting function to `twice`. Your job is to call `echo()`, passing
    3 as an argument. Assign the resulting function to `thrice`.
-   Hit Submit to call `twice()` and `thrice()` and print the results.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define echo
def echo(n):
    """Return the inner_echo function."""

    # Define inner_echo
    def inner_echo(word1):
        """Concatenate n copies of word1."""
        echo_word = word1 * n
        return echo_word

    # Return inner_echo
    return inner_echo

# Call echo: twice
twice = echo(2)

# Call echo: thrice
thrice = echo(3)

# Call twice() and thrice() then print
print(twice('hello'), thrice('hello'))
```

### The keyword nonlocal and nested functions

Let's once again work further on your mastery of scope! In this
exercise, you will use the keyword `nonlocal` within a nested function
to alter the value of a variable defined in the enclosing scope.

-   Assign to `echo_word` the string `word`, concatenated with itself.
-   Use the keyword `nonlocal` to alter the value of `echo_word` in the
    enclosing scope.
-   Alter `echo_word` to `echo_word` concatenated with '!!!'.
-   Call the function `echo_shout()`, passing it a single argument
    'hello'.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define echo_shout()
def echo_shout(word):
    """Change the value of a nonlocal variable"""
    
    # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word
    echo_word = word*2
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)
    
    # Define inner function shout()
    def shout():
        """Alter a variable in the enclosing scope"""
        
        # Use echo_word in nonlocal scope
        nonlocal echo_word
        
        # Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'
        echo_word = echo_word + '!!!'
    
    # Call function shout()
    shout()
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)

# Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'
echo_shout('hello')
```

## Default and flexible arguments

### Functions with one default argument

In the previous chapter, you've learned to define functions with more
than one parameter and then calling those functions by passing the
required number of arguments. In the last video, Hugo built on this idea
by showing you how to define functions with default arguments. You will
practice that skill in this exercise by writing a function that uses a
default argument and then calling the function a couple of times.

-   Complete the function header with the function name `shout_echo`. It
    accepts an argument `word1` and a default argument `echo` with
    default value `1`, in that order.
-   Use the `*` operator to concatenate `echo` copies of `word1`. Assign
    the result to `echo_word`.
-   Call `shout_echo()` with just the string, `"Hey"`. Assign the result
    to `no_echo`.
-   Call `shout_echo()` with the string `"Hey"` and the value `5` for
    the default argument, `echo`. Assign the result to `with_echo`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
     exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
    echo_word = word1 * echo

    # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_word
    shout_word = echo_word + '!!!'

    # Return shout_word
    return shout_word

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey": no_echo
no_echo = shout_echo("Hey")

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey" and echo=5: with_echo
with_echo = shout_echo("Hey", echo=5)

# Print no_echo and with_echo
print(no_echo)
print(with_echo)
```

### Functions with multiple default arguments

You've now defined a function that uses a default argument - don't stop
there just yet! You will now try your hand at defining a function with
more than one default argument and then calling this function in various
ways.

After defining the function, you will call it by supplying values to
*all* the default arguments of the function. Additionally, you will call
the function by not passing a value to one of the default arguments -
see how that changes the output of your function!

-   Complete the function header with the function name `shout_echo`. It
    accepts an argument `word1`, a default argument `echo` with default
    value `1` and a default argument `intense` with default value
    `False`, in that order.
-   In the body of the `if` statement, make the string object
    `echo_word` upper case by applying the method `.upper()` on it.
-   Call `shout_echo()` with the string, `"Hey"`, the value `5` for
    `echo` and the value `True` for `intense`. Assign the result to
    `with_big_echo`.
-   Call `shout_echo()` with the string `"Hey"` and the value `True` for
    `intense`. Assign the result to `big_no_echo`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1, intense=False):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
    echo_word = word1 * echo

    # Make echo_word uppercase if intense is True
    if intense is True:
        # Make uppercase and concatenate '!!!': echo_word_new
        echo_word_new = echo_word.upper() + '!!!'
    else:
        # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: echo_word_new
        echo_word_new = echo_word + '!!!'

    # Return echo_word_new
    return echo_word_new

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey", echo=5 and intense=True: with_big_echo
with_big_echo = shout_echo("Hey", echo=5, intense=True)

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey" and intense=True: big_no_echo
big_no_echo = shout_echo("Hey", intense=True)

# Print with_big_echo and big_no_echo
print(with_big_echo)
print(big_no_echo)
```

### Functions with variable-length arguments (\*args)

Flexible arguments enable you to pass a variable number of arguments to
a function. In this exercise, you will practice defining a function that
accepts a variable number of string arguments.

The function you will define is `gibberish()` which can accept a
variable number of string values. Its return value is a single string
composed of all the string arguments concatenated together in the order
they were passed to the function call. You will call the function with a
single string argument and see how the output changes with another call
using more than one string argument. Recall from the previous video
that, within the function definition, `args` is a tuple.

-   Complete the function header with the function name `gibberish`. It
    accepts a single flexible argument `*args`.
-   Initialize a variable `hodgepodge` to an empty string.
-   Return the variable `hodgepodge` at the end of the function body.
-   Call `gibberish()` with the single string, `"luke"`. Assign the
    result to `one_word`.
-   Hit the Submit button to call `gibberish()` with multiple arguments
    and to print the value to the Shell.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define gibberish
def gibberish(*args):
    """Concatenate strings in *args together."""

    # Initialize an empty string: hodgepodge
    hodgepodge = ''

    # Concatenate the strings in args
    for word in args:
        hodgepodge += word

    # Return hodgepodge
    return hodgepodge

# Call gibberish() with one string: one_word
one_word = gibberish("luke")

# Call gibberish() with five strings: many_words
many_words = gibberish("luke", "leia", "han", "obi", "darth")

# Print one_word and many_words
print(one_word)
print(many_words)
```

### Functions with variable-length keyword arguments (\*\*kwargs)

Let's push further on what you've learned about flexible arguments -
you've used `*args`, you're now going to use `**kwargs`! What makes
`**kwargs` different is that it allows you to pass a variable number of
*keyword arguments* to functions. Recall from the previous video that,
within the function definition, `kwargs` is a dictionary.

To understand this idea better, you're going to use `**kwargs` in this
exercise to define a function that accepts a variable number of keyword
arguments. The function simulates a simple status report system that
prints out the status of a character in a movie.

-   Complete the function header with the function name `report_status`.
    It accepts a single flexible argument `**kwargs`.
-   Iterate over the key-value pairs of `kwargs` to print out the keys
    and values, separated by a colon ':'.
-   In the first call to `report_status()`, pass the following
    keyword-value pairs: `name="luke"`, `affiliation="jedi"` and
    `status="missing"`.
-   In the second call to `report_status()`, pass the following
    keyword-value pairs: `name="anakin"`, `affiliation="sith lord"` and
    `status="deceased"`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define report_status
def report_status(**kwargs):
    """Print out the status of a movie character."""

    print("\nBEGIN: REPORT\n")

    # Iterate over the key-value pairs of kwargs
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        # Print out the keys and values, separated by a colon ':'
        print(key + ": " + value)

    print("\nEND REPORT")

# First call to report_status()
report_status(name="luke", affiliation="jedi", status="missing")

# Second call to report_status()
report_status(name="anakin", affiliation="sith lord", status="deceased")
```

## Bringing it all together

### Bringing it all together (1)

Recall the *Bringing it all together* exercise in the previous chapter
where you did a simple Twitter analysis by developing a function that
counts how many tweets are in certain languages. The output of your
function was a dictionary that had the language as the *keys* and the
counts of tweets in that language as the *value*.

In this exercise, we will generalize the Twitter language analysis that
you did in the previous chapter. You will do that by including a
**default argument** that takes a column name.

For your convenience, `pandas` has been imported as `pd` and the
`'tweets.csv'` file has been imported into the DataFrame `tweets_df`.
Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.

-   Complete the function header by supplying the parameter for a
    DataFrame `df` and the parameter `col_name` with a default value of
    `'lang'` for the DataFrame column name.
-   Call `count_entries()` by passing the `tweets_df` DataFrame and the
    column name `'lang'`. Assign the result to `result1`. Note that
    since `'lang'` is the default value of the `col_name` parameter, you
    don't have to specify it here.
-   Call `count_entries()` by passing the `tweets_df` DataFrame and the
    column name `'source'`. Assign the result to `result2`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]

    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
        if entry in cols_count.keys():
            cols_count[entry] += 1

        # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            cols_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the cols_count dictionary
    return cols_count

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, col_name='lang')

# Call count_entries(): result2
result2 = count_entries(tweets_df, col_name='source')

# Print result1 and result2
print(result1)
print(result2)
```

### Bringing it all together (2)

Wow, you've just generalized your Twitter language analysis that you did
in the previous chapter to include a default argument for the column
name. You're now going to generalize this function one step further by
allowing the user to pass it a flexible argument, that is, in this case,
as many column names as the user would like!

Once again, for your convenience, `pandas` has been imported as `pd` and
the `'tweets.csv'` file has been imported into the DataFrame
`tweets_df`. Parts of the code from your previous work are also
provided.

-   Complete the function header by supplying the parameter for the
    DataFrame `df` and the flexible argument `*args`.
-   Complete the `for` loop within the function definition so that the
    loop occurs over the tuple `args`.
-   Call `count_entries()` by passing the `tweets_df` DataFrame and the
    column name `'lang'`. Assign the result to `result1`.
-   Call `count_entries()` by passing the `tweets_df` DataFrame and the
    column names `'lang'` and `'source'`. Assign the result to
    `result2`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, *args):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    
    #Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}
    
    # Iterate over column names in args
    for col_name in args:
    
        # Extract column from DataFrame: col
        col = df[col_name]
    
        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in col:
    
            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
            if entry in cols_count.keys():
                cols_count[entry] += 1
    
            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
            else:
                cols_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the cols_count dictionary
    return cols_count

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Call count_entries(): result2
result2 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang', 'source')

# Print result1 and result2
print(result1)
print(result2)
```

# Lambda functions and error-handling

Learn about lambda functions, which allow you to write functions quickly and on the fly. You'll also practice handling errors in your functions, which is an essential skill. Then, apply your new skills to answer data science questions.

## Lambda functions

### Pop quiz on lambda functions

In this exercise, you will practice writing a simple lambda function and
calling this function. Recall what you know about lambda functions and
answer the following questions:

-   How would you write a lambda function `add_bangs` that adds three
    exclamation points `'!!!'` to the end of a string `a`?
-   How would you call `add_bangs` with the argument `'hello'`?

You may use the IPython shell to test your code.

- [ ] The lambda function definition is: `add_bangs = (a + '!!!')`, and
    the function call is: `add_bangs('hello')`.
- [x] The lambda function definition is:
    `add_bangs = (lambda a: a + '!!!')`, and the function call is:
    `add_bangs('hello')`.
- [ ] The lambda function definition is:
    `(lambda a: a + '!!!') = add_bangs`, and the function call is:
    `add_bangs('hello')`.

### Writing a lambda function you already know

Some function definitions are simple enough that they can be converted
to a lambda function. By doing this, you write less lines of code, which
is pretty awesome and will come in handy, especially when you're writing
and maintaining big programs. In this exercise, you will use what you
know about lambda functions to convert a function that does a simple
task into a lambda function. Take a look at this function definition:

    def echo_word(word1, echo):
        """Concatenate echo copies of word1."""
        words = word1 * echo
        return words

The function `echo_word` takes 2 parameters: a string value, `word1` and
an integer value, `echo`. It returns a string that is a concatenation of
`echo` copies of `word1`. Your task is to convert this simple function
into a lambda function.

-   Define the lambda function `echo_word` using the variables `word1`
    and `echo`. Replicate what the original function definition for
    `echo_word()` does above.
-   Call `echo_word()` with the string argument `'hey'` and the value
    `5`, in that order. Assign the call to `result`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define echo_word as a lambda function: echo_word
echo_word = (lambda word1, echo: word1 * echo)

# Call echo_word: result
result = echo_word('hey', 5)

# Print result
print(result)
```

### Map() and lambda functions

So far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as
well as to redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use
case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple
functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions.
What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the
environment, unlike a function defined with `def`. To understand this
idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the
`map()` function.

Recall from the video that `map()` applies a function over an object,
such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the
function that `map()` will use to process the object. For example:

    nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)

You can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value `a` to the
power of 2, is passed to `map()` alongside a list of numbers, `nums`.
The *map object* that results from the call to `map()` is stored in
`result`. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with
`map()`. For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the
`add_bangs()` function you defined in previous exercises over a list of
strings.

-   In the `map()` call, pass a lambda function that concatenates the
    string `'!!!'` to a string `item`; also pass the list of strings,
    `spells`. Assign the resulting map object to `shout_spells`.
-   Convert `shout_spells` to a list and print out the list.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a list of strings: spells
spells = ['protego', 'accio', 'expecto patronum', 'legilimens']

# Use map() to apply a lambda function over spells: shout_spells
shout_spells = map(lambda item: item + '!!!', spells)

# Convert shout_spells to a list: shout_spells_list
shout_spells_list = list(shout_spells)

# Print the result
print(shout_spells_list)
```

### Filter() and lambda functions

In the previous exercise, you used lambda functions to anonymously embed
an operation within `map()`. You will practice this again in this
exercise by using a lambda function with `filter()`, which may be new to
you! The function `filter()` offers a way to filter out elements from a
list that don't satisfy certain criteria.

Your goal in this exercise is to use `filter()` to create, from an input
list of strings, a new list that contains only strings that have more
than 6 characters.

-   In the `filter()` call, pass a lambda function and the list of
    strings, `fellowship`. The lambda function should check if the
    number of characters in a string `member` is greater than 6; use the
    `len()` function to do this. Assign the resulting filter object to
    `result`.
-   Convert `result` to a list and print out the list.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'pippin', 'aragorn', 'boromir', 'legolas', 'gimli', 'gandalf']

# Use filter() to apply a lambda function over fellowship: result
result = filter(lambda member: len(member) > 6, fellowship)

# Convert result to a list: result_list
result_list = list(result)

# Print result_list
print(result_list)
```

### Reduce() and lambda functions

You're getting very good at using lambda functions! Here's one more
function to add to your repertoire of skills. The `reduce()` function is
useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike `map()` and
`filter()`, returns a single value as a result. To use `reduce()`, you
must import it from the `functools` module.

Remember `gibberish()` from a few exercises back?

    # Define gibberish
    def gibberish(*args):
        """Concatenate strings in *args together."""
        hodgepodge = ''
        for word in args:
            hodgepodge += word
        return hodgepodge

`gibberish()` simply takes a list of strings as an argument and returns,
as a single-value result, the concatenation of all of these strings. In
this exercise, you will replicate this functionality by using `reduce()`
and a lambda function that concatenates strings together.

-   Import the `reduce` function from the `functools` module.
-   In the `reduce()` call, pass a lambda function that takes two string
    arguments `item1` and `item2` and concatenates them; also pass the
    list of strings, `stark`. Assign the result to `result`. The first
    argument to `reduce()` should be the lambda function and the second
    argument is the list `stark`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Import reduce from functools
from functools import reduce

# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'brandon', 'rickon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
result = reduce(lambda item1, item2: item1 + item2, stark)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Introduction to error handling

### Pop quiz about errors

In the video, Hugo talked about how errors happen when functions are
supplied arguments that they are unable to work with. In this exercise,
you will identify which function call raises an error and what type of
error is raised.

Take a look at the following function calls to `len()`:

    len('There is a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.')

    len(['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'eddard', 'jon'])

    len(525600)

    len(('jaime', 'cersei', 'tywin', 'tyrion', 'joffrey'))

Which of the function calls raises an error and what type of error is
raised?

- [ ] The call
    `len('There is a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.')`
    raises a `TypeError`.
- [ ] The call `len(['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'eddard', 'jon'])` raises an
    `IndexError`.
- [x] The call `len(525600)` raises a `TypeError`.
- [ ] The call `len(('jaime', 'cersei', 'tywin', 'tyrion', 'joffrey'))`
    raises a `NameError`.

### Error handling with try-except

A good practice in writing your own functions is also anticipating the
ways in which other people (or yourself, if you accidentally misuse your
own function) might use the function you defined.

As in the previous exercise, you saw that the `len()` function is able
to handle input arguments such as strings, lists, and tuples, but not
int type ones and raises an appropriate error and error message when it
encounters invalid input arguments. One way of doing this is through
exception handling with the `try-except` block.

In this exercise, you will define a function as well as use a
`try-except` block for handling cases when incorrect input arguments are
passed to the function.

Recall the `shout_echo()` function you defined in previous exercises;
parts of the function definition are provided in the sample code. Your
goal is to complete the exception handling code in the function
definition and provide an appropriate error message when raising an
error.

-   Initialize the variables `echo_word` and `shout_words` to empty
    strings.
-   Add the keywords `try` and `except` in the appropriate locations for
    the exception handling block.
-   Use the `*` operator to concatenate `echo` copies of `word1`. Assign
    the result to `echo_word`.
-   Concatenate the string `'!!!'` to `echo_word`. Assign the result to
    `shout_words`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Initialize empty strings: echo_word, shout_words
    echo_word = ''
    shout_words = ''

    # Add exception handling with try-except
    try:
        # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
        echo_word = word1 * echo

        # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_words
        shout_words = echo_word + '!!!'
    except:
        # Print error message
        print("word1 must be a string and echo must be an integer.")

    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words

# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo="accelerator")
```

### Error handling by raising an error

Another way to raise an error is by using `raise`. In this exercise, you
will add a `raise` statement to the `shout_echo()` function you defined
before to raise an error message when the value supplied by the user to
the `echo` argument is less than 0.

The call to `shout_echo()` uses valid argument values. To test and see
how the `raise` statement works, simply change the value for the `echo`
argument to a *negative* value. Don't forget to change it back to valid
values to move on to the next exercise!

-   Complete the `if` statement by checking if the value of `echo` is
    *less than* 0.
-   In the body of the `if` statement, add a `raise` statement that
    raises a `ValueError` with message
    `'echo must be greater than or equal to 0'` when the value supplied
    by the user to `echo` is less than 0.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    # Raise an error with raise
    if echo < 0:
        raise ValueError('echo must be greater than or equal to 0')

    # Concatenate echo copies of word1 using *: echo_word
    echo_word = word1 * echo

    # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: shout_word
    shout_word = echo_word + '!!!'

    # Return shout_word
    return shout_word

# Call shout_echo
shout_echo("particle", echo=5)
```

## Bringing it all together

### Bringing it all together (1)

This is awesome! You have now learned how to write anonymous functions
using `lambda`, how to pass lambda functions as arguments to other
functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, as well as how to
write errors and output custom error messages within your functions. You
will now put together these learnings to good use by working with a
Twitter dataset. Before practicing your new error handling skills; in
this exercise, you will write a lambda function and use `filter()` to
select retweets, that is, tweets that begin with the string `'RT'`.

To help you accomplish this, the Twitter data has been imported into the
DataFrame, `tweets_df`. Go for it!

-   In the `filter()` call, pass a lambda function and the sequence of
    tweets as strings, `tweets_df['text']`. The lambda function should
    check if the first 2 characters in a tweet `x` are 'RT'. Assign the
    resulting filter object to `result`. To get the first 2 characters
    in a tweet `x`, use `x[0:2]`. To check equality, use a Boolean
    filter with `==`.
-   Convert `result` to a list and print out the list.

```{python, eval=F}
# Select retweets from the Twitter DataFrame: result
result = filter(lambda x: x[0:2] == 'RT', tweets_df['text'])

# Create list from filter object result: res_list
res_list = list(result)

# Print all retweets in res_list
for tweet in res_list:
    print(tweet)
```

### Bringing it all together (2)

Sometimes, we make mistakes when calling functions - even ones *you*
made yourself. But don't fret! In this exercise, you will improve on
your previous work with the `count_entries()` function in the last
chapter by adding a `try-except` block to it. This will allow your
function to provide a helpful message when the user calls your
`count_entries()` function but provides a column name that isn't in the
DataFrame.

Once again, for your convenience, `pandas` has been imported as `pd` and
the `'tweets.csv'` file has been imported into the DataFrame
`tweets_df`. Parts of the code from your previous work are also
provided.

-   Add a `try` block so that when the function is called with the
    correct arguments, it processes the DataFrame and returns a
    dictionary of results.
-   Add an `except` block so that when the function is called
    incorrectly, it displays the following error message:
    `'The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.'`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}

    # Add try block
    try: 
        # Extract column from DataFrame: col
        col = df[col_name]
        
        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in col:
    
            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
            if entry in cols_count.keys():
                cols_count[entry] += 1
            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
            else:
                cols_count[entry] = 1
    
        # Return the cols_count dictionary
        return cols_count

    # Add except block
    except:
        print('The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.')

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print result1
print(result1)
```

### Bringing it all together (3)

In the previous exercise, you built on your function `count_entries()`
to add a `try-except` block. This was so that users would get helpful
messages when calling your `count_entries()` function and providing a
column name that isn't in the DataFrame. In this exercise, you'll
instead raise a `ValueError` in the case that the user provides a column
name that isn't in the DataFrame.

Once again, for your convenience, `pandas` has been imported as `pd` and
the `'tweets.csv'` file has been imported into the DataFrame
`tweets_df`. Parts of the code from your previous work are also
provided.

-   If `col_name` is *not* a column in the DataFrame `df`, raise a
    `ValueError 'The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.'`.
-   Call your new function `count_entries()` to analyze the `'lang'`
    column of `tweets_df`. Store the result in `result1`.
-   Print `result1`. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer'
    to check out the result. In the next exercise, you'll see that it
    raises the necessary `ValueErrors`.

```{python, eval=F}

### Bringing it all together: testing your error handling skills

You have just written error handling into your `count_entries()`
function so that, when the user passes the function a column (as 2nd
argument) NOT contained in the DataFrame (1st argument), a `ValueError`
is thrown. You're now going to play with this function: it is loaded
into pre-exercise code, as is the DataFrame `tweets_df`. Try calling
`count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')` to confirm that the function behaves
as it should. Then call `count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang1')`: what is the
last line of the output?

- [ ] 'ValueError: The DataFrame does not have the requested column.'
- [x] 'ValueError: The DataFrame does not have a lang1 column.'
- [ ] 'TypeError: The DataFrame does not have the requested column.'

## Congratulations!

### Congratulations!

Well done. You're now well on your way to being a Pythonista Data Science ninja.

### What you’ve learned:

You're now able to write functions in Python that accept single and multiple arguments and can return as many values as you please. You're also adept at using default and flexible arguments and keyword arguments. You've gained insight into scoping in Python, can write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. You've also gained invaluable practice in using all of these techniques to write functions that are useful in a Data Science context. You have come a long way in your developing practice as a budding Pythonista Data Scientist.

### There’s more to learn!

There are more basic skills that you will need to learn in Python to be valuable as a working Data Scientist and many of these we'll cover in the sequel to this course so if you're finding yourself still thirsty for more Pythonista Data Science chops, I'd head over there right now. There you'll learn all about list comprehensions, which allow you to wrangle data in lists to create other lists, a tool utilized by all Data Scientists working in Python. You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. Iterators are everywhere in PythonLand and, to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate Data Science protocols and procedures over sets of objects; these are a couple of the cool functionalities in PythonLand you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both of these courses.

### Let's practice!

I'm looking forward to seeing you there and congratulations once again!
