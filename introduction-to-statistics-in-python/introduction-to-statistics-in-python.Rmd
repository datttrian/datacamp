**Course Description**

Statistics is the study of how to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. Itâ€™s a hugely valuable tool that you can use to bring the future into focus and infer the answer to tons of questions. For example, what is the likelihood of someone purchasing your product, how many calls will your support team receive, and how many jeans sizes should you manufacture to fit 95% of the population? In this course, you'll discover how to answer questions like these as you grow your statistical skills and learn how to calculate averages, use scatterplots to show the relationship between numeric values, and calculate correlation. You'll also tackle probability, the backbone of statistical reasoning, and learn how to use Python to conduct a well-designed study to draw your own conclusions from data.

# Summary Statistics

Summary statistics gives you the tools you need to boil down massive datasets to reveal the highlights. In this chapter, you'll explore summary statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation, and learn how to accurately interpret them. You'll also develop your critical thinking skills, allowing you to choose the best summary statistics for your data.

## What is statistics?

### Descriptive and inferential statistics

Statistics can be used to answer lots of different types of questions, but being able to identify which type of statistics is needed is essential to drawing accurate conclusions. In this exercise, you'll sharpen your skills by identifying which type is needed to answer each question.

-   Identify which questions can be answered with descriptive statistics and which questions can be answered with inferential statistics.

##### Descriptive

- Given data on all 100,000 people who viewed an ad, what percent of
people clicked on it?
- Given data on every customer service request made, what's the average
time it took to respond?

##### Inferential

- After interviewing 100 customers, what percent of *all* your customers
are satisfied with your product?
- Given data on 20 fish caught in a lake, what's the average weight of all
fish in the lake?

### Data type classification

In the video, you learned about two main types of data: numeric and categorical. Numeric variables can be classified as either discrete or continuous, and categorical variables can be classified as either nominal or ordinal. These characteristics of a variable determine which ways of summarizing your data will work best.

-   Map each variable to its data type by dragging each item and dropping it into the correct data type.

##### Continuous numeric

- Air temperature
- Kilowatts of electricity used

##### Discrete numeric

- Number of items in stock
- Number of clicks on an ad
- Number of DataCamp courses taken

##### Categorical

- Brand of a product
- Zip code


## Measures of center

### Mean and median

In this chapter, you'll be working with the [2018 Food Carbon Footprint
Index](https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018)
from nu3. The `food_consumption` dataset contains information about the
kilograms of food consumed per person per year in each country in each
food category (`consumption`) as well as information about the carbon
footprint of that food category (`co2_emissions`) measured in kilograms
of carbon dioxide, or CO<sub>2</sub>, per person per year in each
country.

In this exercise, you'll compute measures of center to compare food
consumption in the US and Belgium using your `pandas` and `numpy`
skills.

`pandas` is imported as `pd` for you and `food_consumption` is
pre-loaded.

-   Import `numpy` with the alias `np`.
-   Create two DataFrames: one that holds the rows of `food_consumption`
    for `'Belgium'` and another that holds rows for `'USA'`. Call these
    `be_consumption` and `usa_consumption`.
-   Calculate the mean and median of kilograms of food consumed per
    person per year for both countries.

<!-- -->

-   Subset `food_consumption` for rows with data about Belgium and the
    USA.
-   Group the subsetted data by `country` and select only the
    `consumption` column.
-   Calculate the mean and median of the kilograms of food consumed per
    person per year in each country using `.agg()`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
food_consumption = pd.read_csv("food_consumption.csv")

# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium
be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']

# Filter for USA
usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption in USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Subset for Belgium and USA only
be_and_usa = food_consumption[(food_consumption['country'] == "Belgium") | (food_consumption['country'] == 'USA')]

# Group by country, select consumption column, and compute mean and median
print(be_and_usa.groupby('country')['consumption'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```

### Mean vs. median

In the video, you learned that the mean is the sum of all the data
points divided by the total number of data points, and the median is the
middle value of the dataset where 50% of the data is less than the
median, and 50% of the data is greater than the median. In this
exercise, you'll compare these two measures of center.

`pandas` is loaded as `pd`, `numpy` is loaded as `np`, and
`food_consumption` is available.

-   Import `matplotlib.pyplot` with the alias `plt`.
-   Subset `food_consumption` to get the rows where `food_category` is
    `'rice'`.
-   Create a histogram of `co2_emission` for rice and show the plot.

Take a look at the histogram you just created of different countries' CO2 emissions for rice. Which of the following terms best describes the shape of the data?

- [ ] No skew
- [ ] Left-skewed
- [x] Right-skewed

-   Use `.agg()` to calculate the mean and median of `co2_emission` for rice.

Given the skew of this data, what measure of central tendency best summarizes the kilograms of CO2 emissions per person per year for rice?

- [ ] Mean
- [x] Median
- [ ] Both mean and median

```{python, eval=F}
# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'rice']

# Histogram of co2_emission for rice and show plot
rice_consumption['co2_emission'].hist()
plt.show()

# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'rice']

# Calculate mean and median of co2_emission with .agg()
print(rice_consumption['co2_emission'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```

## Measures of spread

### Quartiles, quantiles, and quintiles

Quantiles are a great way of summarizing numerical data since they can
be used to measure center and spread, as well as to get a sense of where
a data point stands in relation to the rest of the data set. For
example, you might want to give a discount to the 10% most active users
on a website.

In this exercise, you'll calculate quartiles, quintiles, and deciles,
which split up a dataset into 4, 5, and 10 pieces, respectively.

Both `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np` are loaded and
`food_consumption` is available.

-   Calculate the quartiles of the `co2_emission` column of
    `food_consumption`.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the six quantiles that split up the data into 5 pieces
    (quintiles) of the `co2_emission` column of `food_consumption`.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the eleven quantiles of `co2_emission` that split up the
    data into ten pieces (deciles).

```{python, eval=F}
# Calculate the quartiles of co2_emission
print(np.quantile(food_consumption['co2_emission'], [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]))

# Calculate the quintiles of co2_emission
print(np.quantile(food_consumption['co2_emission'], [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]))

# Calculate the deciles of co2_emission
print(np.quantile(food_consumption['co2_emission'], np.linspace(0, 1, 11)))
```

### Variance and standard deviation

Variance and standard deviation are two of the most common ways to
measure the spread of a variable, and you'll practice calculating these
in this exercise. Spread is important since it can help inform
expectations. For example, if a salesperson sells a mean of 20 products
a day, but has a standard deviation of 10 products, there will probably
be days where they sell 40 products, but also days where they only sell
one or two. Information like this is important, especially when making
predictions.

Both `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np` are loaded, and
`food_consumption` is available.

-   Calculate the variance and standard deviation of `co2_emission` for
    each `food_category` by grouping and aggregating.
-   Import `matplotlib.pyplot` with alias `plt`.
-   Create a histogram of `co2_emission` for the `beef` `food_category`
    and show the plot.
-   Create a histogram of `co2_emission` for the `eggs` `food_category`
    and show the plot.

```{python, eval=F}
# Print variance and sd of co2_emission for each food_category
print(food_consumption.groupby('food_category')['co2_emission'].agg([np.var, np.std]))

# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create histogram of co2_emission for food_category 'beef'
food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'beef']['co2_emission'].hist()
# Show plot
plt.show()

# Create histogram of co2_emission for food_category 'eggs'
food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'eggs']['co2_emission'].hist()
# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### Finding outliers using IQR

Outliers can have big effects on statistics like mean, as well as
statistics that rely on the mean, such as variance and standard
deviation. Interquartile range, or IQR, is another way of measuring
spread that's less influenced by outliers. IQR is also often used to
find outliers. If a value is less than \\\text{Q1} - 1.5 \times
\text{IQR}\\ or greater than \\\text{Q3} + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}\\, it's
considered an outlier. In fact, this is how the lengths of the whiskers
in a `matplotlib` box plot are calculated.

![Diagram of a box plot showing median, quartiles, and
outliers](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5758/datasets/ca7e6e1832be7ec1842f62891815a9b0488efa83/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-28%20at%2010.04.54%20AM.png)

In this exercise, you'll calculate IQR and use it to find some outliers.
`pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np` are loaded and `food_consumption`
is available.

-   Calculate the total `co2_emission` per country by grouping by
    country and taking the sum of `co2_emission`. Store the resulting
    DataFrame as `emissions_by_country`.
-   Compute the first and third quartiles of `emissions_by_country` and store these as `q1` and `q3`.
-   Calculate the interquartile range of `emissions_by_country` and store it as `iqr`.
-   Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers of `emissions_by_country`, and store these as `lower` and `upper`.


```{python, eval=F}
# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country = food_consumption.groupby('country')['co2_emission'].sum()

print(emissions_by_country)

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country = food_consumption.groupby('country')['co2_emission'].sum()

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of emissions_by_country
q1 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.25)
q3 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country = food_consumption.groupby('country')['co2_emission'].sum()

# Compute the first and third quantiles and IQR of emissions_by_country
q1 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.25)
q3 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1

# Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers
lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country = food_consumption.groupby('country')['co2_emission'].sum()

# Compute the first and third quantiles and IQR of emissions_by_country
q1 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.25)
q3 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1

# Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers
lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

# Subset emissions_by_country to find outliers
outliers = emissions_by_country[(emissions_by_country < lower) | (emissions_by_country > upper)]
print(outliers)
```

# Random Numbers and Probability

In this chapter, you'll learn how to generate random samples and measure chance using probability. You'll work with real-world sales data to calculate the probability of a salesperson being successful. Finally, youâ€™ll use the binomial distribution to model events with binary outcomes.

## What are the chances?

### With or without replacement?

In the video, you learned about two different ways of taking samples: with replacement and without replacement. Although it isn't always easy to tell which best fits various situations, it's important to correctly identify this so that any probabilities you report are accurate. In this exercise, you'll put your new knowledge to the test and practice figuring this out.

-   For each scenario, decide whether it's sampling with replacement or sampling without replacement.

##### With replacement

- Flipping a coin 3 times
- Rolling a die twice

##### Without replacement

- From a deck of cards, dealing 3 players 7 cards each
- Randomly picking 3 people to work on the weekend from a group of 20
people
- Randomly selecting 5 products from the assembly line to test for quality
assurance

### Calculating probabilities

You're in charge of the sales team, and it's time for performance
reviews, starting with Amir. As part of the review, you want to randomly
select a few of the deals that he's worked on over the past year so that
you can look at them more deeply. Before you start selecting deals,
you'll first figure out what the chances are of selecting certain deals.

Recall that the probability of an event can be calculated by $$
P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{# ways event can happen}}{\text{total \#
of possible outcomes}} $$

Both `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np` are loaded and `amir_deals` is
available.

-   Count the number of deals Amir worked on for each `product` type and
    store in `counts`.
-   Calculate the probability of selecting a deal for the different product types by dividing the counts by the total number of deals Amir worked on. Save this as `probs`.

If you randomly select one of Amir's deals, what's the probability that the deal will involve Product C?

- [ ] 15%
- [ ] 80.43%
- [x] 8.43%
- [ ] 22.5%
- [ ] 124.3%

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
amir_deals = pd.read_csv("amir_deals.csv")

# Count the deals for each product
counts = amir_deals['product'].value_counts()
print(counts)

# Count the deals for each product
counts = amir_deals['product'].value_counts()

# Calculate probability of picking a deal with each product
probs = counts / amir_deals.shape[0]
print(probs)
```

### Sampling deals

In the previous exercise, you counted the deals Amir worked on. Now it's
time to randomly pick five deals so that you can reach out to each
customer and ask if they were satisfied with the service they received.
You'll try doing this both with and without replacement.

Additionally, you want to make sure this is done randomly and that it
can be reproduced in case you get asked how you chose the deals, so
you'll need to set the random seed before sampling from the deals.

Both `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np` are loaded and `amir_deals` is
available.

-   Set the random seed to `24`.
-   Take a sample of `5` deals **without** replacement and store them as
    `sample_without_replacement`.
-   Take a sample of 5 deals **with** replacement and save as `sample_with_replacement`.

What type of sampling is better to use for this situation?

- [ ] With replacement
- [x] Without replacement
- [ ] It doesn't matter

```{python, eval=F}
# Set random seed
np.random.seed(24)

# Sample 5 deals without replacement
sample_without_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5)
print(sample_without_replacement)

# Set random seed
np.random.seed(24)

# Sample 5 deals with replacement
sample_with_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5, replace=True)
print(sample_with_replacement)
```

## Discrete distributions

### Creating a probability distribution

A new restaurant opened a few months ago, and the restaurant's
management wants to optimize its seating space based on the size of the
groups that come most often. On one night, there are 10 groups of people
waiting to be seated at the restaurant, but instead of being called in
the order they arrived, they will be called randomly. In this exercise,
you'll investigate the probability of groups of different sizes getting
picked first. Data on each of the ten groups is contained in the
`restaurant_groups` DataFrame.

Remember that expected value can be calculated by multiplying each
possible outcome with its corresponding probability and taking the sum.
The `restaurant_groups` data is available. `pandas` is loaded as `pd`,
`numpy` is loaded as `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is loaded as `plt`.

-   Create a histogram of the `group_size` column of
    `restaurant_groups`, setting `bins` to `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Remember
    to show the plot.

<!-- -->

-   Count the number of each `group_size` in `restaurant_groups`, then
    divide by the number of rows in `restaurant_groups` to calculate the
    probability of randomly selecting a group of each size. Save as
    `size_dist`.
-   Reset the index of `size_dist`.
-   Rename the columns of `size_dist` to `group_size` and `prob`.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the expected value of the `size_distribution`, which
    represents the expected group size, by multiplying the `group_size`
    by the `prob` and taking the sum.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the probability of randomly picking a group of 4 or more
    people by subsetting for groups of size 4 or more and summing the
    probabilities of selecting those groups.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
restaurant_groups = pd.read_csv("restaurant_groups.csv")

# Create a histogram of restaurant_groups and show plot
restaurant_groups['group_size'].hist(bins=np.linspace(2,6,5))
plt.show()

# Create probability distribution
size_dist = restaurant_groups['group_size'].value_counts() / restaurant_groups.shape[0]

# Reset index and rename columns
size_dist = size_dist.reset_index()
size_dist.columns = ['group_size', 'prob']

print(size_dist)

# Create probability distribution
size_dist = restaurant_groups['group_size'].value_counts() / restaurant_groups.shape[0]
# Reset index and rename columns
size_dist = size_dist.reset_index()
size_dist.columns = ['group_size', 'prob']

# Expected value
expected_value = np.sum(size_dist['group_size'] * size_dist['prob'])
print(expected_value)

# Create probability distribution
size_dist = restaurant_groups['group_size'].value_counts() / restaurant_groups.shape[0]
# Reset index and rename columns
size_dist = size_dist.reset_index()
size_dist.columns = ['group_size', 'prob']

# Expected value
expected_value = np.sum(size_dist['group_size'] * size_dist['prob'])

# Subset groups of size 4 or more
groups_4_or_more = size_dist[size_dist['group_size'] >= 4]

# Sum the probabilities of groups_4_or_more
prob_4_or_more = np.sum(groups_4_or_more['prob'])
print(prob_4_or_more)
```

### Identifying distributions

Which sample is most likely to have been taken from a uniform
distribution?

![A: bell-shaped distribution, B: relatively flat distribution, C: lots
of lower values, fewer high
values](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5786/datasets/bd64d4775ec28f36b081d92aa38a391033c03b8f/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-04%20at%204.35.58%20PM.png)

- [ ] A
- [x] B
- [ ] C

## Expected value vs. sample mean

The app to the right will take a sample from a discrete uniform
distribution, which includes the numbers 1 through 9, and calculate the
sample's mean. You can adjust the size of the sample using the slider.
Note that the expected value of this distribution is 5.

A sample is taken, and you win twenty dollars if the sample's mean is
less than 4. There's a catch: you get to pick the sample's size.

Which sample size is ***most likely*** to win you the twenty dollars?

- [x] 10
- [ ] 100
- [ ] 1000
- [ ] 5000
- [ ] 10000

## Continuous distributions

### Which distribution?

At this point, you've learned about the two different variants of the
uniform distribution: the discrete uniform distribution, and the
continuous uniform distribution. In this exercise, you'll decide which
situations follow which distribution.

![Illustration of discrete and continuous uniform
distributions](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5786/datasets/fe928d4c840f66544c6228b8b755e9bf15361b9f/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-04%20at%205.18.16%20PM.png)

-   Recall from the first chapter that discrete variables can often be thought of as "counted" variables, while continuous variables are usually things that can be measured.

##### Discrete uniform

- The outcome of rolling a 4-sided die.
- The ticket number of a raffle winner, assuming there is one ticket for
each number from 1 to 100.

##### Continuous uniform

- The time you'll have to wait for a geyser to erupt if you show up at a
random time, knowing that the geyser erupts exactly every ten minutes.
- The time of day a baby will be born.

##### Other

- The height of a random person.

### Data back-ups

The sales software used at your company is set to automatically back
itself up, but no one knows exactly what time the back-ups happen. It is
known, however, that back-ups happen exactly every 30 minutes. Amir
comes back from sales meetings at random times to update the data on the
client he just met with. He wants to know how long he'll have to wait
for his newly-entered data to get backed up. Use your new knowledge of
continuous uniform distributions to model this situation and answer
Amir's questions.

-   To model how long Amir will wait for a back-up using a continuous
    uniform distribution, save his lowest possible wait time as
    `min_time` and his longest possible wait time as `max_time`.
    Remember that back-ups happen every 30 minutes.

<!-- -->

-   Import `uniform` from `scipy.stats` and calculate the probability
    that Amir has to wait less than 5 minutes, and store in a variable
    called `prob_less_than_5`.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait more than 5 minutes,
    and store in a variable called `prob_greater_than_5`.

<!-- -->

-   Calculate the probability that Amir has to wait between 10 and 20
    minutes, and store in a variable called `prob_between_10_and_20`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting less than 5 mins
prob_less_than_5 = uniform.cdf(5, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_less_than_5)

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting more than 5 mins
prob_greater_than_5 = 1 - uniform.cdf(5, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_greater_than_5)

# Min and max wait times for back-up that happens every 30 min
min_time = 0
max_time = 30

# Import uniform from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Calculate probability of waiting 10-20 mins
prob_between_10_and_20 = uniform.cdf(20, min_time, max_time) - uniform.cdf(10, min_time, max_time)
print(prob_between_10_and_20)
```

### Simulating wait times

To give Amir a better idea of how long he'll have to wait, you'll
simulate Amir waiting 1000 times and create a histogram to show him what
he should expect. Recall from the last exercise that his minimum wait
time is 0 minutes and his maximum wait time is 30 minutes.

As usual, `pandas` as `pd`, `numpy` as `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` as
`plt` are loaded.

-   Set the random seed to `334`.
-   Import `uniform` from `scipy.stats`.
-   Generate 1000 wait times from the continuous uniform distribution that models Amir's wait time. Save this as `wait_times`.
-   Create a histogram of the simulated wait times and show the plot.

```{python, eval=F}
# Set random seed to 334
np.random.seed(334)

# Set random seed to 334
np.random.seed(334)

# Import uniform
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Set random seed to 334
np.random.seed(334)

# Import uniform
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Generate 1000 wait times between 0 and 30 mins
wait_times = uniform.rvs(0, 30, size=1000)

print(wait_times)

# Set random seed to 334
np.random.seed(334)

# Import uniform
from scipy.stats import uniform

# Generate 1000 wait times between 0 and 30 mins
wait_times = uniform.rvs(0, 30, size=1000)

# Create a histogram of simulated times and show plot
plt.hist(wait_times)
plt.show()
```

## The binomial distribution

### Simulating sales deals

Assume that Amir usually works on 3 deals per week, and overall, he wins
30% of deals he works on. Each deal has a binary outcome: it's either
lost, or won, so you can model his sales deals with a binomial
distribution. In this exercise, you'll help Amir simulate a year's worth
of his deals so he can better understand his performance.

`numpy` is imported as `np`.

-   Import `binom` from `scipy.stats` and set the random seed to 10.

<!-- -->

-   Simulate 1 deal worked on by Amir, who wins 30% of the deals he
    works on.

<!-- -->

-   Simulate a typical week of Amir's deals, or one week of 3 deals.

<!-- -->

-   Simulate a year's worth of Amir's deals, or 52 weeks of 3 deals
    each, and store in `deals`.
-   Print the mean number of deals he won per week.

```{python, eval=F}
# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate a single deal
print(binom.rvs(1, 0.3, size=1))

# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate 1 week of 3 deals
print(binom.rvs(3, 0.3, size=1))

# Import binom from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import binom

# Set random seed to 10
np.random.seed(10)

# Simulate 52 weeks of 3 deals
deals = binom.rvs(3, 0.3, size=52)

# Print mean deals won per week
print(np.mean(deals))
```

### Calculating binomial probabilities

Just as in the last exercise, assume that Amir wins 30% of deals. He
wants to get an idea of how likely he is to close a certain number of
deals each week. In this exercise, you'll calculate what the chances are
of him closing different numbers of deals using the binomial
distribution.

`binom` is imported from `scipy.stats`.

-   What's the probability that Amir closes all 3 deals in a week? Save
    this as `prob_3`.
-   What's the probability that Amir closes 1 or fewer deals in a week? Save this as `prob_less_than_or_equal_1`.
-   What's the probability that Amir closes more than 1 deal? Save this as `prob_greater_than_1`.


```{python, eval=F}
# Probability of closing 3 out of 3 deals
prob_3 = binom.pmf(3, 3, 0.3)

print(prob_3)

# Probability of closing <= 1 deal out of 3 deals
prob_less_than_or_equal_1 = binom.cdf(1, 3, 0.3)

print(prob_less_than_or_equal_1)

# Probability of closing > 1 deal out of 3 deals
prob_greater_than_1 = 1 - binom.cdf(1, 3, 0.3)

print(prob_greater_than_1)
```

### How many sales will be won?

Now Amir wants to know how many deals he can expect to close each week
if his win rate changes. Luckily, you can use your binomial distribution
knowledge to help him calculate the expected value in different
situations. Recall from the video that the expected value of a binomial
distribution can be calculated by \\n \times p\\.

-   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the **3** he works on
    that Amir will win each week if he maintains his 30% win rate.
-   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the 3 he works on that
    he'll win if his win rate drops to 25%.
-   Calculate the expected number of sales out of the 3 he works on that
    he'll win if his win rate rises to 35%.

```{python, eval=F}
# Expected number won with 30% win rate
won_30pct = 3 * 0.3
print(won_30pct)

# Expected number won with 25% win rate
won_25pct = 3 * 0.25
print(won_25pct)

# Expected number won with 35% win rate
won_35pct = 3 * 0.35
print(won_35pct)
```

# More Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

Itâ€™s time to explore one of the most important probability distributions in statistics, normal distribution. Youâ€™ll create histograms to plot normal distributions and gain an understanding of the central limit theorem, before expanding your knowledge of statistical functions by adding the Poisson, exponential, and t-distributions to your repertoire.

## The normal distribution

### Distribution of Amir's sales

Since each deal Amir worked on (both won and lost) was different, each
was worth a different amount of money. These values are stored in the
`amount` column of `amir_deals` As part of Amir's performance review,
you want to be able to estimate the probability of him selling different
amounts, but before you can do this, you'll need to determine what kind
of distribution the `amount` variable follows.

Both `pandas` as `pd` and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` are loaded and
`amir_deals` is available.

-   Create a histogram with 10 bins to visualize the distribution of the
    `amount`. Show the plot.

Which probability distribution do the sales `amounts` most closely follow?

- [ ] Uniform
- [ ] Binomial
- [x] Normal
- [ ] None of the above

```{python, eval=F}
# Histogram of amount with 10 bins and show plot
amir_deals['amount'].hist(bins=10)
plt.show()
```

### Probabilities from the normal distribution

Since each deal Amir worked on (both won and lost) was different, each
was worth a different amount of money. These values are stored in the
`amount` column of `amir_deals` and follow a normal distribution with a
mean of 5000 dollars and a standard deviation of 2000 dollars. As part
of his performance metrics, you want to calculate the probability of
Amir closing a deal worth various amounts.

`norm` from `scipy.stats` is imported as well as `pandas` as `pd`. The
DataFrame `amir_deals` is loaded.

-   What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth less than $7500?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth more than $1000?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability of Amir closing a deal worth between $3000
    and $7000?

<!-- -->

-   What amount will 25% of Amir's sales be *less than*?

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
from scipy.stats import norm

# Probability of deal < 7500
prob_less_7500 = norm.cdf(7500, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_less_7500)

# Probability of deal > 1000
prob_over_1000 = 1 - norm.cdf(1000, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_over_1000)

# Probability of deal between 3000 and 7000
prob_3000_to_7000 = norm.cdf(7000, 5000, 2000) - norm.cdf(3000, 5000, 2000)

print(prob_3000_to_7000)

# Calculate amount that 25% of deals will be less than
pct_25 = norm.ppf(0.25, 5000, 2000)

print(pct_25)
```

### Simulating sales under new market conditions

The company's financial analyst is predicting that next quarter, the
worth of each sale will increase by 20% and the volatility, or standard
deviation, of each sale's worth will increase by 30%. To see what Amir's
sales might look like next quarter under these new market conditions,
you'll simulate new sales amounts using the normal distribution and
store these in the `new_sales` DataFrame, which has already been created
for you.

In addition, `norm` from `scipy.stats`, `pandas` as `pd`, and
`matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` are loaded.

-   Currently, Amir's average sale amount is $5000. Calculate what his
    new average amount will be if it increases by 20% and store this in
    `new_mean`.
-   Amir's current standard deviation is $2000. Calculate what his new
    standard deviation will be if it increases by 30% and store this in
    `new_sd`.
-   Create a variable called `new_sales`, which contains 36 simulated
    amounts from a normal distribution with a mean of `new_mean` and a
    standard deviation of `new_sd`.
-   Plot the distribution of the `new_sales` `amount`s using a histogram
    and show the plot.

```{python, eval=F}
# Calculate new average amount
new_mean = 5000 * 1.2

# Calculate new standard deviation
new_sd = 2000 * 1.3

# Simulate 36 new sales
new_sales = norm.rvs(new_mean, new_sd, size=36)

# Create histogram and show
plt.hist(new_sales)
plt.show()
```

### Which market is better?

The key metric that the company uses to evaluate salespeople is the
percent of sales they make over $1000 since the time put into each sale
is usually worth a bit more than that, so the higher this metric, the
better the salesperson is performing.

Recall that Amir's current sales amounts have a mean of $5000 and a
standard deviation of $2000, and Amir's predicted amounts in next
quarter's market have a mean of $6000 and a standard deviation of $2600.

`norm` from `scipy.stats` is imported.

Based ***only*** on the metric of **percent of sales over $1000**, does
Amir perform better in the current market or the predicted market?


- [ ] Amir performs much better in the current market.
- [ ] Amir performs much better in next quarter's predicted market.
- [x] Amir performs about equally in both markets.

## The central limit theorem

### Visualizing sampling distributions

On the right, try creating sampling distributions of different summary statistics from samples of different distributions. Which distribution does the central limit theorem **not** apply to?


- [ ] Discrete uniform distribution
- [ ] Continuous uniform distribution
- [ ] Binomial distribution
- [ ] All of the above
- [x] None of the above

### The CLT in action

The central limit theorem states that a sampling distribution of a
sample statistic approaches the normal distribution as you take more
samples, no matter the original distribution being sampled from.

In this exercise, you'll focus on the sample mean and see the central
limit theorem in action while examining the `num_users` column of
`amir_deals` more closely, which contains the number of people who
intend to use the product Amir is selling.

`pandas` as `pd`, `numpy` as `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` are
loaded and `amir_deals` is available.

-   Create a histogram of the `num_users` column of `amir_deals` and
    show the plot.
-   Set the seed to `104`.
-   Take a sample of size `20` with replacement from the `num_users` column of `amir_deals`, and take the mean.
-   Repeat this 100 times using a `for` loop and store as `sample_means`. This will take 100 different samples and calculate the mean of each.
-   Convert `sample_means` into a `pd.Series`, create a histogram of the `sample_means`, and show the plot.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a histogram of num_users and show
amir_deals['num_users'].hist()
plt.show()

# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

# Sample 20 num_users with replacement from amir_deals
samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)

# Take mean of samp_20
print(np.mean(samp_20))

# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

# Sample 20 num_users with replacement from amir_deals and take mean
samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
np.mean(samp_20)

sample_means = []
# Loop 100 times
for i in range(100):
  # Take sample of 20 num_users
  samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
  # Calculate mean of samp_20
  samp_20_mean = np.mean(samp_20)
  # Append samp_20_mean to sample_means
  sample_means.append(samp_20_mean)
  
print(sample_means)

# Set seed to 104
np.random.seed(104)

sample_means = []
# Loop 100 times
for i in range(100):
  # Take sample of 20 num_users
  samp_20 = amir_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
  # Calculate mean of samp_20
  samp_20_mean = np.mean(samp_20)
  # Append samp_20_mean to sample_means
  sample_means.append(samp_20_mean)
  
# Convert to Series and plot histogram
sample_means_series = pd.Series(sample_means)
sample_means_series.hist()
# Show plot
plt.show()
```

### The mean of means

You want to know what the average number of users (`num_users`) is per
deal, but you want to know this number for the entire company so that
you can see if Amir's deals have more or fewer users than the company's
average deal. The problem is that over the past year, the company has
worked on more than ten thousand deals, so it's not realistic to compile
all the data. Instead, you'll estimate the mean by taking several random
samples of deals, since this is much easier than collecting data from
everyone in the company.

`amir_deals` is available and the user data for all the company's deals
is available in `all_deals`. Both `pandas` as `pd` and `numpy` as `np`
are loaded.

-   Set the random seed to `321`.
-   Take 30 samples (with replacement) of size 20 from
    `all_deals['num_users']` and take the mean of each sample. Store the
    sample means in `sample_means`.
-   Print the mean of `sample_means`.
-   Print the mean of the `num_users` column of `amir_deals`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
all_deals = pd.read_csv("all_deals.csv")

# Set seed to 321
np.random.seed(321)

sample_means = []
# Loop 30 times to take 30 means
for i in range(30):
  # Take sample of size 20 from num_users col of all_deals with replacement
  cur_sample = all_deals['num_users'].sample(20, replace=True)
  # Take mean of cur_sample
  cur_mean = np.mean(cur_sample)
  # Append cur_mean to sample_means
  sample_means.append(cur_mean)

# Print mean of sample_means
print(np.mean(sample_means))

# Print mean of num_users in amir_deals
print(np.mean(amir_deals['num_users']))
```

## The Poisson distribution

## Identifying lambda

Now that you've learned about the Poisson distribution, you know that its shape is described by a value called lambda. In this exercise, you'll match histograms to lambda values.

Match each Poisson distribution to its lambda value.

##### lambda = 1

![highest probabilities at 0 and 1](https://bit.ly/3jfoa7q)

##### lambda = 4

![highest probabilities at 3 and 4](https://bit.ly/2CeVBqi)

##### lambda = 8

![highest probabilities at 7 and 8](https://bit.ly/2Bc4wrW)

### Tracking lead responses

Your company uses sales software to keep track of new sales leads. It
organizes them into a queue so that anyone can follow up on one when
they have a bit of free time. Since the number of lead responses is a
countable outcome over a period of time, this scenario corresponds to a
Poisson distribution. On average, Amir responds to 4 leads each day. In
this exercise, you'll calculate probabilities of Amir responding to
different numbers of leads.

-   Import `poisson` from `scipy.stats` and calculate the probability
    that Amir responds to 5 leads in a day, given that he responds to an
    average of 4.

<!-- -->

-   Amir's coworker responds to an average of 5.5 leads per day. What is
    the probability that she answers 5 leads in a day?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability that Amir responds to 2 or fewer leads in a
    day?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability that Amir responds to more than 10 leads in a
    day?

```{python, eval=F}
# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 5 responses
prob_5 = poisson.pmf(5, 4)

print(prob_5)

# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 5 responses
prob_coworker = poisson.pmf(5, 5.5)

print(prob_coworker)

# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of 2 or fewer responses
prob_2_or_less = poisson.cdf(2, 4)

print(prob_2_or_less)

# Import poisson from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Probability of > 10 responses
prob_over_10 = 1 - poisson.cdf(10, 4)

print(prob_over_10)
```

## More probability distributions

## Distribution dragging and dropping

By this point, you've learned about so many different probability distributions that it can be difficult to remember which is which. In this exercise, you'll practice distinguishing between distributions and identifying the distribution that best matches different scenarios.

-   Match each situation to the distribution that best models it.

##### Poisson

- Number of customers that enter a store each hour
- Number of products sold each week

##### Exponential

- Amount of time until someone pays off their loan
- Amount of time until the next customer makes a purchase

##### Binomial

- Number of people from a group of 30 that pass their driving test

### Modeling time between leads

To further evaluate Amir's performance, you want to know how much time
it takes him to respond to a lead after he opens it. On average, he
responds to 1 request every 2.5 hours. In this exercise, you'll
calculate probabilities of different amounts of time passing between
Amir receiving a lead and sending a response.

-   Import `expon` from `scipy.stats`. What's the probability it takes
    Amir less than an hour to respond to a lead?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability it takes Amir more than 4 hours to respond to
    a lead?

<!-- -->

-   What's the probability it takes Amir 3-4 hours to respond to a lead?

```{python, eval=F}
# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes < 1 hour
print(expon.cdf(1, scale=2.5))

# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes > 4 hours
print(1 - expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5))

# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes 3-4 hours
print(expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5) - expon.cdf(3, scale=2.5))
```

### The t-distribution

Which statement is **not** true regarding the t-distribution?

- [ ] The t-distribution has thicker tails than the normal distribution.
- [ ] A t-distribution with high degrees of freedom resembles the normal distribution.
- [ ] The number of degrees of freedom affects the distribution's variance.
- [x] The t-distribution is skewed.

# Correlation and Experimental Design

In this chapter, you'll learn how to quantify the strength of a linear relationship between two variables, and explore how confounding variables can affect the relationship between two other variables. You'll also see how a studyâ€™s design can influence its results, change how the data should be analyzed, and potentially affect the reliability of your conclusions.

## Correlation

### Guess the correlation

On the right, use the scatterplot to estimate what the correlation is
between the variables `x` and `y`. Once you've guessed it correctly, use
the **New Plot** button to try out a few more scatterplots. When you're
ready, answer the question below to continue to the next exercise.

Which of the following statements is NOT true about correlation?

- [ ] If the correlation between `x` and `y` has a high magnitude, the
    data points will be clustered closely around a line.
- [ ] Correlation can be written as *r*.
- [ ] If `x` and `y` are negatively correlated, values of `y` decrease as
    values of `x` increase.
- [x] Correlation cannot be 0.

### Relationships between variables

In this chapter, you'll be working with a dataset `world_happiness`
containing results from the [2019 World Happiness
Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/). The report scores
various countries based on how happy people in that country are. It also
ranks each country on various societal aspects such as social support,
freedom, corruption, and others. The dataset also includes the GDP per
capita and life expectancy for each country.

In this exercise, you'll examine the relationship between a country's
life expectancy (`life_exp`) and happiness score (`happiness_score`)
both visually and quantitatively. `seaborn` as `sns`,
`matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `pandas` as `pd` are loaded and
`world_happiness` is available.

-   Create a scatterplot of `happiness_score` vs. `life_exp` (without a
    trendline) using `seaborn`.
-   Show the plot.
-   Create a scatterplot of `happiness_score` vs. `life_exp` **with a
    linear trendline** using `seaborn`, setting `ci` to `None`.
-   Show the plot.

Based on the scatterplot, which is most likely the correlation between `life_exp` and `happiness_score`?

- [ ] 0.3
- [ ] -0.3
- [x] 0.8
- [ ] -0.8

-   Calculate the correlation between `life_exp` and `happiness_score`. Save this as `cor`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import seaborn as sns
world_happiness = pd.read_csv("world_happiness.csv", index_col = 0)

# Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp and show
sns.scatterplot(x='life_exp', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
sns.lmplot(x='life_exp', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness, ci=None)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
sns.lmplot(x='life_exp', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness, ci=None)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Correlation between life_exp and happiness_score
cor = world_happiness['life_exp'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])

print(cor)
```

## Correlation caveats

### What can't correlation measure?

While the correlation coefficient is a convenient way to quantify the
strength of a relationship between two variables, it's far from perfect.
In this exercise, you'll explore one of the caveats of the correlation
coefficient by examining the relationship between a country's GDP per
capita (`gdp_per_cap`) and happiness score.

`pandas` as `pd`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `seaborn` as `sns`
are imported, and `world_happiness` is loaded.

-   Create a `seaborn` scatterplot (without a trendline) showing the
    relationship between `gdp_per_cap` (on the x-axis) and `life_exp`
    (on the y-axis).
-   Show the plot
-   Calculate the correlation between `gdp_per_cap` and `life_exp` and store as `cor`.

The correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy is 0.7. Why
is correlation ***not*** the best way to measure the relationship
between these two variables?

- [ ] Correlation measures how one variable affects another.
- [x] Correlation only measures linear relationships.
- [ ] Correlation cannot properly measure relationships between numeric
    variables.
    
```{python, eval=F}
# Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='life_exp', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()

# Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='life_exp', data=world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()
  
# Correlation between gdp_per_cap and life_exp
cor = world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['life_exp'])

print(cor)
```

### Transforming variables

When variables have skewed distributions, they often require a
transformation in order to form a linear relationship with another
variable so that correlation can be computed. In this exercise, you'll
perform a transformation yourself.

`pandas` as `pd`, `numpy` as `np`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and
`seaborn` as `sns` are imported, and `world_happiness` is loaded.

-   Create a scatterplot of `happiness_score` versus `gdp_per_cap` and
    calculate the correlation between them.

<!-- -->

-   Add a new column to `world_happiness` called `log_gdp_per_cap` that
    contains the log of `gdp_per_cap`.
-   Create a `seaborn` scatterplot of `happiness_score` versus
    `log_gdp_per_cap`.
-   Calculate the correlation between `log_gdp_per_cap` and
    `happiness_score`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. gdp_per_cap
sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Calculate correlation
cor = world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
print(cor)

# Create log_gdp_per_cap column
world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'] = np.log(world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'])

# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. log_gdp_per_cap
sns.scatterplot(x='log_gdp_per_cap', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Calculate correlation
cor = world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
print(cor)
```

### Does sugar improve happiness?

A new column has been added to `world_happiness` called
`grams_sugar_per_day`, which contains the average amount of sugar eaten
per person per day in each country. In this exercise, you'll examine the
effect of a country's average sugar consumption on its happiness score.

`pandas` as `pd`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`, and `seaborn` as `sns`
are imported, and `world_happiness` is loaded.

-   Create a `seaborn` scatterplot showing the relationship between
    `grams_sugar_per_day` (on the x-axis) and `happiness_score` (on the
    y-axis).
-   Calculate the correlation between `grams_sugar_per_day` and
    `happiness_score`.

Based on this data, which statement about sugar consumption and happiness scores is true?

- [ ] Increased sugar consumption leads to a higher happiness score.
- [ ] Lower sugar consumption results in a lower happiness score
- [x] Increased sugar consumption is associated with a higher happiness score.
- [ ] Sugar consumption is not related to happiness.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
world_happiness = pd.read_csv("world_happiness_full.csv")

# Scatterplot of grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
sns.scatterplot(x='grams_sugar_per_day', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness)
plt.show()

# Correlation between grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
cor = world_happiness['grams_sugar_per_day'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
print(cor)
```

### Confounders

A study is investigating the relationship between neighborhood residence and lung capacity. Researchers measure the lung capacity of thirty people from neighborhood A, which is located near a highway, and thirty people from neighborhood B, which is not near a highway. Both groups have similar smoking habits and a similar gender breakdown.

Which of the following could be a confounder in this study?


- [ ] Lung capacity
- [ ] Neighborhood
- [x] Air pollution
- [ ] Smoking status
- [ ] Gender

## Design of experiments

### Study types

While controlled experiments are ideal, many situations and research questions are not conducive to a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, causation can likely be inferred if the control and test groups have similar characteristics and don't have any systematic difference between them. On the other hand, causation cannot usually be inferred from observational studies, whose results are often misinterpreted as a result.

In this exercise, you'll practice distinguishing controlled experiments from observational studies.

-   Determine if each study is a controlled experiment or observational study.

##### Controlled experiment

- Subjects are randomly assigned to a diet and weight loss is compared.
- Asthma symptoms are compared between children randomly assigned to
receive professional home pest management services or pest management
education.
- Purchasing rates are compared between users of an e-commerce site who
are randomly directed to a new version of the home page or an old
version.

##### Observational study

- Prevalence of heart disease is compared between veterans with PTSD and
veterans without PTSD.
- A week ago, the home page of an e-commerce site was updated. Purchasing
rates are compared between users who saw the old and new home page
versions.

## Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies

A company manufactures thermometers, and they want to study the relationship between a thermometer's age and its accuracy. To do this, they take a sample of 100 different thermometers of different ages and test how accurate they are. Is this data longitudinal or cross-sectional?

- [ ] Longitudinal
- [x] Cross-sectional
- [ ] Both
- [ ] Neither
