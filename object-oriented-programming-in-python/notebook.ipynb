    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a widely used programming paradigm that reduces development times—making it easier to read, reuse, and maintain your code. OOP shifts the focus from thinking about code as a sequence of actions to looking at your program as a collection of objects that interact with each other. In this course, you’ll learn how to create classes, which act as the blueprints for every object in Python. You’ll then leverage principles called inheritance and polymorphism to reuse and optimize code. Dive in and learn how to create beautiful code that’s clean and efficient!\n",
    "\n",
    "# OOP Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn what object-oriented programming (OOP) is, how it differs from procedural-programming, and how it can be applied. You'll then define your own classes, and learn how to create methods, attributes, and constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP termininology\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a lot of terminology at once -- classes, objects, methods, attributes… Before you start writing your own object-oriented code, make sure you have a solid grasp on the main concepts of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Classify the cards into the correct buckets. Are the statements true or false?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### True\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** is a software design practice of bundling the data and\n",
    "the methods that operate on that data.\n",
    "- **Methods** encode behavior of an object and are represented by\n",
    "functions.\n",
    "- **Attributes** encode the state of an object and are represented by\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### False\n",
    "\n",
    "- A programming language can be either object-oriented or procedural, but\n",
    "not both.\n",
    "- *Object* and *class* are different terms describing the same concept.\n",
    "- `.columns` is an example of a method of a DataFrame object.\n",
    "- **Object** is an abstract template describing the general states and\n",
    "behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring object interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn how to write object-oriented code is to study the\n",
    "design of existing classes. You've already learned about exploration\n",
    "tools like `type()` and `dir()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important function is `help()`: calling `help(x)` in the console\n",
    "will show the documentation for the object or class `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most real world classes have many methods and attributes, and it is easy\n",
    "to get lost, so in this exercise, you will start with something simpler.\n",
    "We have defined a class, and created an object of that class called\n",
    "`mystery`. Explore the object in the console using the tools that you\n",
    "learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "What class does the `mystery` object have?\n",

    "- [ ] `salesforce.Customer`\n",
    "- [ ] It doesn't have a class\n",
    "\n",
    "So the `mystery` object is an `Employee`! Explore it in the console\n",
    "further to find out what attributes it has.\n",

    "-   Print the `mystery` employee's `name` attribute.\n",
    "-   Print the employee's salary.\n",

    "### Congratulations!\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this course on introduction to object-oriented programming in Python. You've done a great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned how to think about your code in terms of classes and objects; how to create attributes and methods. You explored inheritance and polymorphism -- two ideas that allows you to leverage and customize existing code in powerful ways. You also learned the distinction between class-level data and instance-level data. What does it mean for two objects to be equal? Turns out, it can mean anything you want, as you learned in chapter 3. You defined custom equality functions, readable string representations, even built your own exceptions. Finally, you learned what makes a relationship between classes suitable for inheritance, how Python handles private vs public data, and how to use properties to manage data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where can you go from here? You could start by expanding your knowledge of functionality available in Python. For example, learn about mix-in classes and multiple inheritance -- a highly debated feature of Python that isn't present in many other object-oriented languages. You could learn how to override more built-in operators, like arithmetic operators, or the length operator; how to customize attribute access even more using special methods; how to create your own iterator classes that you could use to index loops. You could learn about abstract base classes used to create interfaces, or how leverage dataclasses -- a new type of class that is especially suitable for data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider learning more about object-oriented design, which is based on SOLID principles. Solid is an acronym, and you've already learned about the \"L\" is SOLID -- the Liskov substitution principle, but the other 4 letters are just as important. Finally, I encourage you to learn more about design patterns -- reusable solutions addressing most common problems in software design.\n",
    "\n",
