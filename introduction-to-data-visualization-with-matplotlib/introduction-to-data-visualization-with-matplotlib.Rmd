**Course Description**

Visualizing data in plots and figures exposes the underlying patterns in the data and provides insights. Good visualizations also help you communicate your data to others, and are useful to data analysts and other consumers of the data. In this course, you will learn how to use Matplotlib, a powerful Python data visualization library. Matplotlib provides the building blocks to create rich visualizations of many different kinds of datasets. You will learn how to create visualizations for different kinds of data and how to customize, automate, and share these visualizations.

# Introduction to Matplotlib

This chapter introduces the Matplotlib visualization library and demonstrates how to use it with data.

## Introduction to data visualization with Matplotlib

### Using the matplotlib.pyplot interface

There are many ways to use Matplotlib. In this course, we will focus on
the `pyplot` interface, which provides the most flexibility in creating
and customizing data visualizations.

Initially, we will use the `pyplot` interface to create two kinds of
objects: `Figure` objects and `Axes` objects.

*This course introduces a lot of new concepts, so if you ever need a
quick refresher, download the [Matplotlib Cheat
Sheet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/v1676360378/Marketing/Blog/Matplotlib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
and keep it handy!*

-   Import the `matplotlib.pyplot` API, using the conventional name
    `plt`.
-   Create `Figure` and `Axes` objects using the `plt.subplots`
    function.
-   Show the results, an empty set of axes, using the `plt.show`
    function.

```{python, eval=F}
# Import the matplotlib.pyplot submodule and name it plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Figure and an Axes with plt.subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Call the show function to show the result
plt.show()
```

### Adding data to an Axes object

Adding data to a figure is done by calling methods of the `Axes` object.
In this exercise, we will use the `plot` method to add data about
rainfall in two American cities: Seattle, WA and Austin, TX.

The data are stored in two pandas DataFrame objects that are already
loaded into memory: `seattle_weather` stores information about the
weather in Seattle, and `austin_weather` stores information about the
weather in Austin. Each of the DataFrames has a `"MONTH"` column that
stores the three-letter name of the months. Each also has a column named
`"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` that stores the average rainfall in each month
during a ten-year period.

In this exercise, you will create a visualization that will allow you to
compare the rainfall in these two cities.

-   Import the `matplotlib.pyplot` submodule as `plt`.
-   Create a Figure and an Axes object by calling `plt.subplots`.
-   Add data from the `seattle_weather` DataFrame by calling the Axes
    `plot` method.
-   Add data from the `austin_weather` DataFrame in a similar manner and
    call `plt.show` to show the results.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
import calendar
austin_weather = pd.read_csv('austin_weather.csv')
austin_weather['MONTH'] = austin_weather['DATE']
seattle_weather = pd.read_csv('seattle_weather.csv')
seattle_weather = seattle_weather[seattle_weather['STATION'] == 'USW00094290']
seattle_weather['MONTH'] = seattle_weather['DATE']


# Import the matplotlib.pyplot submodule and name it plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a Figure and an Axes with plt.subplots
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot MLY-PRCP-NORMAL from seattle_weather against MONTH
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Plot MLY-PRCP-NORMAL from austin_weather against MONTH
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Call the show function
plt.show()
```

## Customizing your plots

### Customizing data appearance

We can customize the appearance of data in our plots, while adding the
data to the plot, using key-word arguments to the plot command.

In this exercise, you will customize the appearance of the markers, the
linestyle that is used, and the color of the lines and markers for your
data.

As before, the data is already provided in pandas DataFrame objects
loaded into memory: `seattle_weather` and `austin_weather`. These each
have a `"MONTHS"` column and a `"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` that you will plot
against each other.

In addition, a Figure object named `fig` and an Axes object named `ax`
have already been created for you.

-   Call `ax.plot` to plot `"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` against `"MONTHS"` in
    both DataFrames.
-   Pass the `color` key-word arguments to these commands to set the
    color of the Seattle data to blue ('b') and the Austin data to red
    ('r').
-   Pass the `marker` key-word arguments to these commands to set the
    Seattle data to circle markers ('o') and the Austin markers to
    triangles pointing downwards ('v').
-   Pass the `linestyle` key-word argument to use dashed lines for the
    data from both cities ('--').

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot Seattle data, setting data appearance
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"],
        color='b', marker='o', linestyle='--')

# Plot Austin data, setting data appearance
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"],
        color='r', marker='v', linestyle='--')

# Call show to display the resulting plot
plt.show()
```

### Customizing axis labels and adding titles

Customizing the axis labels requires using the `set_xlabel` and
`set_ylabel` methods of the Axes object. Adding a title uses the
`set_title` method.

In this exercise, you will customize the content of the axis labels and
add a title to a plot.

As before, the data is already provided in pandas DataFrame objects
loaded into memory: `seattle_weather` and `austin_weather`. These each
have a `"MONTH"` column and a `"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` column. These data are
plotted against each other in the first two lines of the sample code
provided.

In addition, a Figure object named `fig` and an Axes object named `ax`
have already been created for you.

-   Use the `set_xlabel` method to add the label: `"Time (months)"`.
-   Use the `set_ylabel` method to add the label:
    `"Precipitation (inches)"`.
-   Use the `set_title` method to add the title:
    `"Weather patterns in Austin and Seattle"`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# Customize the x-axis label
ax.set_xlabel("Time (months)")

# Customize the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Precipitation (inches)")

# Add the title
ax.set_title("Weather patterns in Austin and Seattle")

# Display the figure
plt.show()
```

## Small multiples

### Creating a grid of subplots

How would you create a `Figure` with 6 `Axes` objects organized in 3
rows and 2 columns?

- [ ] `fig, ax = plt.subplots((3, 2))`
- [ ] `fig, ax = plt.axes((2, 3))`
- [x] `fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 2)`
- [ ] `fig, ax = plt.subplots((2, 3))`

### Creating small multiples with plt.subplots

Small multiples are used to plot several datasets side-by-side. In
Matplotlib, small multiples can be created using the `plt.subplots()`
function. The first argument is the number of rows in the array of Axes
objects generate and the second argument is the number of columns. In
this exercise, you will use the Austin and Seattle data to practice
creating and populating an array of subplots.

The data is given to you in DataFrames: `seattle_weather` and
`austin_weather`. These each have a `"MONTH"` column and
`"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` (for average precipitation), as well as
`"MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"` (for average temperature) columns. In this exercise,
you will plot in a separate subplot the monthly average precipitation
and average temperatures in each city.

-   Create a Figure and an array of subplots with 2 rows and 2 columns.
-   Addressing the top left Axes as index 0, 0, plot the Seattle
    precipitation.
-   In the top right (index 0,1), plot Seattle temperatures.
-   In the bottom left (1, 0) and bottom right (1, 1) plot Austin
    precipitations and temperatures.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a Figure and an array of subplots with 2 rows and 2 columns
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2)

# Addressing the top left Axes as index 0, 0, plot month and Seattle precipitation
ax[0, 0].plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# In the top right (index 0,1), plot month and Seattle temperatures
ax[0, 1].plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])

# In the bottom left (1, 0) plot month and Austin precipitations
ax[1, 0].plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"])

# In the bottom right (1, 1) plot month and Austin temperatures
ax[1, 1].plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()
```

### Small multiples with shared y axis

When creating small multiples, it is often preferable to make sure that
the different plots are displayed with the same scale used on the
y-axis. This can be configured by setting the `sharey` key-word to
`True`.

In this exercise, you will create a Figure with two Axes objects that
share their y-axis. As before, the data is provided in `seattle_weather`
and `austin_weather` DataFrames.

-   Create a Figure with an array of two Axes objects that share their
    y-axis range.
-   Plot Seattle's `"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` in a solid blue line in the top
    Axes.
-   Add Seattle's `"MLY-PRCP-25PCTL"` and `"MLY-PRCP-75PCTL"` in dashed
    blue lines to the top Axes.
-   Plot Austin's `"MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"` in a solid red line in the bottom
    Axes and the `"MLY-PRCP-25PCTL"` and `"MLY-PRCP-75PCTL"` in dashed
    red lines.

```{python, eval=F}
# Create a figure and an array of axes: 2 rows, 1 column with shared y axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharey=True)

# Plot Seattle precipitation in the top axes
ax[0].plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"], color='b')
ax[0].plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-25PCTL"], color='b', linestyle='--')
ax[0].plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-PRCP-75PCTL"], color='b', linestyle='--')

# Plot Austin precipitation in the bottom axes
ax[1].plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-NORMAL"], color='r')
ax[1].plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-25PCTL"], color='r', linestyle='--')
ax[1].plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-PRCP-75PCTL"], color='r', linestyle='--')

plt.show()
```

# Plotting time-series

Time series data is data that is recorded. Visualizing this type of data helps clarify trends and illuminates relationships between data.

## Plotting time-series data

### Read data with a time index

pandas DataFrame objects can have an index that denotes time. This is
useful because Matplotlib recognizes that these measurements represent
time and labels the values on the axis accordingly.

In this exercise, you will read data from a CSV file called
`climate_change.csv` that contains measurements of CO2 levels and
temperatures made on the 6th of every month from 1958 until 2016. You
will use pandas' `read_csv` function.

To designate the index as a `DateTimeIndex`, you will use the
`parse_dates` and `index_col` key-word arguments both to parse this
column as a variable that contains dates and also to designate it as the
index for this DataFrame.

*By the way, if you haven't downloaded it already, check out the
[Matplotlib Cheat
Sheet](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e1a8f39d-71ad-4d13-9a6b-618fe1b8c9e9).
It includes an overview of the most important concepts, functions and
methods and might come in handy if you ever need a quick refresher!*

-   Import the pandas library as `pd`.
-   Read in the data from a CSV file called `'climate_change.csv'` using
    `pd.read_csv`.
-   Use the `parse_dates` key-word argument to parse the `"date"` column
    as dates.
-   Use the `index_col` key-word argument to set the `"date"` column as
    the index.

```{python, eval=F}
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read the data from file using read_csv
climate_change = pd.read_csv('climate_change.csv', parse_dates=["date"], index_col="date")
```

### Plot time-series data

To plot time-series data, we use the `Axes` object `plot` command. The
first argument to this method are the values for the x-axis and the
second argument are the values for the y-axis.

This exercise provides data stored in a DataFrame called
`climate_change`. This variable has a time-index with the dates of
measurements and two data columns: `"co2"` and `"relative_temp"`.

In this case, the index of the DataFrame would be used as the x-axis
values and we will plot the values stored in the `"relative_temp"`
column as the y-axis values. We will also properly label the x-axis and
y-axis.

-   Add the data from `climate_change` to the plot: use the DataFrame
    `index` for the x value and the `"relative_temp"` column for the y
    values.
-   Set the x-axis label to `'Time'`.
-   Set the y-axis label to `'Relative temperature (Celsius)'`.
-   Show the figure.

```{python, eval=F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add the time-series for "relative_temp" to the plot
ax.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change['relative_temp'])

# Set the x-axis label
ax.set_xlabel('Time')

# Set the y-axis label 
ax.set_ylabel('Relative temperature (Celsius)')

# Show the figure
plt.show()
```

### Using a time index to zoom in

When a time-series is represented with a time index, we can use this
index for the x-axis when plotting. We can also select a range of dates
to zoom in on a particular period within the time-series using pandas'
indexing facilities. In this exercise, you will select a portion of a
time-series dataset and you will plot that period.

The data to use is stored in a DataFrame called `climate_change`, which
has a time-index with dates of measurements and two data columns:
`"co2"` and `"relative_temp"`.

-   Use `plt.subplots` to create a Figure with one Axes called `fig` and
    `ax`, respectively.
-   Create a variable called `seventies` that includes all the data
    between `"1970-01-01"` and `"1979-12-31"`.
-   Add the data from `seventies` to the plot: use the DataFrame `index`
    for the x value and the `"co2"` column for the y values.

```{python, eval=F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Use plt.subplots to create fig and ax
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Create variable seventies with data from "1970-01-01" to "1979-12-31"
seventies = climate_change["1970-01-01":"1979-12-31"]

# Add the time-series for "co2" data from seventies to the plot
ax.plot(seventies.index, seventies["co2"])

# Show the figure
plt.show()
```

## Plotting time-series with different variables

### Plotting two variables

If you want to plot two time-series variables that were recorded at the
same times, you can add both of them to the same subplot.

If the variables have very different scales, you'll want to make sure
that you plot them in different twin Axes objects. These objects can
share one axis (for example, the time, or x-axis) while not sharing the
other (the y-axis).

To create a twin Axes object that shares the x-axis, we use the `twinx`
method.

In this exercise, you'll have access to a DataFrame that has the
`climate_change` data loaded into it. This DataFrame was loaded with the
`"date"` column set as a `DateTimeIndex`, and it has a column called
`"co2"` with carbon dioxide measurements and a column called
`"relative_temp"` with temperature measurements.

-   Use `plt.subplots` to create a Figure and Axes objects called `fig`
    and `ax`, respectively.
-   Plot the carbon dioxide variable in blue using the Axes `plot`
    method.
-   Use the Axes `twinx` method to create a twin Axes that shares the
    x-axis.
-   Plot the relative temperature variable in red on the twin Axes using
    its `plot` method.

```{python, eval=F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initalize a Figure and Axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the CO2 variable in blue
ax.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change["co2"], color='blue')

# Create a twin Axes that shares the x-axis
ax2 = ax.twinx()

# Plot the relative temperature in red
ax2.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change["relative_temp"], color='red')

plt.show()
```

### Defining a function that plots time-series data

Once you realize that a particular section of code that you have written
is useful, it is a good idea to define a function that saves that
section of code for you, rather than copying it to other parts of your
program where you would like to use this code.

Here, we will define a function that takes inputs such as a time
variable and some other variable and plots them as x and y inputs. Then,
it sets the labels on the x- and y-axis and sets the colors of the
y-axis label, the y-axis ticks and the tick labels.

-   Define a function called `plot_timeseries` that takes as input an
    Axes object (`axes`), data (`x`,`y`), a string with the name of a
    color and strings for x- and y-axis labels.
-   Plot y as a function of in the color provided as the input `color`.
-   Set the x- and y-axis labels using the provided input `xlabel` and
    `ylabel`, setting the y-axis label color using `color`.
-   Set the y-axis tick parameters using the `tick_params` method of the
    Axes object, setting the `colors` key-word to `color`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Define a function called plot_timeseries
def plot_timeseries(axes, x, y, color, xlabel, ylabel):

  # Plot the inputs x,y in the provided color
  axes.plot(x, y, color=color)

  # Set the x-axis label
  axes.set_xlabel(xlabel)

  # Set the y-axis label
  axes.set_ylabel(ylabel, color=color)

  # Set the colors tick params for y-axis
  axes.tick_params('y', colors=color)
```

### Using a plotting function

Defining functions allows us to reuse the same code without having to
repeat all of it. Programmers sometimes say ["Don't repeat
yourself"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

In the previous exercise, you defined a function called
`plot_timeseries`:

    plot_timeseries(axes, x, y, color, xlabel, ylabel)

that takes an Axes object (as the argument `axes`), time-series data (as
`x` and `y` arguments) the name of a color (as a string, provided as the
`color` argument) and x-axis and y-axis labels (as `xlabel` and `ylabel`
arguments). In this exercise, the function `plot_timeseries` is already
defined and provided to you.

Use this function to plot the `climate_change` time-series data,
provided as a pandas DataFrame object that has a DateTimeIndex with the
dates of the measurements and `co2` and `relative_temp` columns.

-   In the provided `ax` object, use the function `plot_timeseries` to
    plot the `"co2"` column in blue, with the x-axis label
    `"Time (years)"` and y-axis label `"CO2 levels"`.
-   Use the `ax.twinx` method to add an Axes object to the figure that
    shares the x-axis with `ax`.
-   Use the function `plot_timeseries` to add the data in the
    `"relative_temp"` column in red to the twin Axes object, with the
    x-axis label `"Time (years)"` and y-axis label
    `"Relative temperature (Celsius)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the CO2 levels time-series in blue
plot_timeseries(ax, climate_change.index, climate_change["co2"], 'blue', "Time (years)", "CO2 levels")

# Create a twin Axes object that shares the x-axis
ax2 = ax.twinx()

# Plot the relative temperature data in red
plot_timeseries(ax2, climate_change.index, climate_change['relative_temp'], 'red', "Time (years)", "Relative temperature (Celsius)")

plt.show()
```

## Annotating time-series data

### Annotating a plot of time-series data

Annotating a plot allows us to highlight interesting information in the
plot. For example, in describing the climate change dataset, we might
want to point to the date at which the relative temperature first
exceeded 1 degree Celsius.

For this, we will use the `annotate` method of the Axes object. In this
exercise, you will have the `DataFrame` called `climate_change` loaded
into memory. Using the Axes methods, plot only the relative temperature
column as a function of dates, and annotate the data.

-   Use the `ax.plot` method to plot the DataFrame index against the
    `relative_temp` column.
-   Use the `annotate` method to add the text `'>1 degree'` in the
    location `(pd.Timestamp('2015-10-06'), 1)`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the relative temperature data
ax.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change['relative_temp'])

# Annotate the date at which temperatures exceeded 1 degree
ax.annotate(">1 degree", xy=(pd.Timestamp('2015-10-06'), 1))

plt.show()
```

### Plotting time-series: putting it all together

In this exercise, you will plot two time-series with different scales on
the same Axes, and annotate the data from one of these series.

The CO2/temperatures data is provided as a DataFrame called
`climate_change`. You should also use the function that we have defined
before, called `plot_timeseries`, which takes an Axes object (as the
`axes` argument) plots a time-series (provided as `x` and `y`
arguments), sets the labels for the x-axis and y-axis and sets the color
for the data, and for the y tick/axis labels:

    plot_timeseries(axes, x, y, color, xlabel, ylabel)

Then, you will annotate with text an important time-point in the data:
on 2015-10-06, when the temperature first rose to above 1 degree over
the average.

-   Use the `plot_timeseries` function to plot CO2 levels against time.
    Set xlabel to `"Time (years)"` ylabel to `"CO2 levels"` and color to
    `'blue'`.
-   Create `ax2`, as a twin of the first Axes.
-   In `ax2`, plot temperature against time, setting the color ylabel to
    `"Relative temp (Celsius)"` and color to `'red'`.
-   Annotate the data using the `ax2.annotate` method. Place the text
    `">1 degree"` in x=`pd.Timestamp('2008-10-06')`, y=`-0.2` pointing
    with a gray thin arrow to x=`pd.Timestamp('2015-10-06')`, y = `1`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the CO2 levels time-series in blue
plot_timeseries(ax, climate_change.index, climate_change["co2"], 'blue', "Time (years)", "CO2 levels")

# Create an Axes object that shares the x-axis
ax2 = ax.twinx()

# Plot the relative temperature data in red
plot_timeseries(ax2, climate_change.index, climate_change['relative_temp'], 'red', "Time (years)", "Relative temp (Celsius)")

# Annotate the point with relative temperature >1 degree
ax2.annotate(">1 degree", xy=(pd.Timestamp('2015-10-06'), 1), xytext=(pd.Timestamp('2008-10-06'), -0.2), arrowprops={'arrowstyle':'->', 'color':'gray'})

plt.show()
```

# Quantitative comparisons and statistical visualizations

Visualizations can be used to compare data in a quantitative manner. This chapter explains several methods for quantitative visualizations.

## Quantitative comparisons: bar-charts

### Bar chart

Bar charts visualize data that is organized according to categories as a
series of bars, where the height of each bar represents the values of
the data in this category.

For example, in this exercise, you will visualize the number of gold
medals won by each country in the provided `medals` DataFrame. The
DataFrame contains the countries as the index, and a column called
`"Gold"` that contains the number of gold medals won by each country,
according to their rows.

-   Call the `ax.bar` method to plot the `"Gold"` column as a function
    of the country.
-   Use the `ax.set_xticklabels` to set the x-axis tick labels to be the
    country names.
-   In the call to `ax.set_xticklabels` rotate the x-axis tick labels by
    90 degrees by using the `rotation` key-word argument.
-   Set the y-axis label to `"Number of medals"`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
medals = pd.read_csv('medals_by_country_2016.csv', index_col = 0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot a bar-chart of gold medals as a function of country
ax.bar(medals.index, medals["Gold"])

# Set the x-axis tick labels to the country names
ax.set_xticklabels(medals.index, rotation=90)

# Set the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Number of medals")

plt.show()
```

### Stacked bar chart

A stacked bar chart contains bars, where the height of each bar
represents values. In addition, stacked on top of the first variable may
be another variable. The *additional* height of this bar represents the
value of this variable. And you can add more bars on top of that.

In this exercise, you will have access to a DataFrame called `medals`
that contains an index that holds the names of different countries, and
three columns: `"Gold"`, `"Silver"` and `"Bronze"`. You will also have a
Figure, `fig`, and Axes, `ax`, that you can add data to.

You will create a stacked bar chart that shows the number of gold,
silver, and bronze medals won by each country, and you will add labels
and create a legend that indicates which bars represent which medals.

-   Call the `ax.bar` method to add the `"Gold"` medals. Call it with
    the `label` set to `"Gold"`.
-   Call the `ax.bar` method to stack `"Silver"` bars on top of that,
    using the `bottom` key-word argument so the bottom of the bars will
    be on top of the gold medal bars, and `label` to add the label
    `"Silver"`.
-   Use `ax.bar` to add `"Bronze"` bars on top of that, using the
    `bottom` key-word and `label` it as `"Bronze"`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add bars for "Gold" with the label "Gold"
ax.bar(medals.index, medals["Gold"], label="Gold")

# Stack bars for "Silver" on top with label "Silver"
ax.bar(medals.index, medals["Silver"], bottom=medals["Gold"], label="Silver")

# Stack bars for "Bronze" on top of that with label "Bronze"
ax.bar(medals.index, medals["Bronze"], bottom=medals["Gold"] + medals["Silver"], label="Bronze")

# Display the legend
ax.legend()

plt.show()
```

## Quantitative comparisons: histograms

### Creating histograms

Histograms show the full distribution of a variable. In this exercise,
we will display the distribution of weights of medalists in gymnastics
and in rowing in the 2016 Olympic games for a comparison between them.

You will have two DataFrames to use. The first is called `mens_rowing`
and includes information about the medalists in the men's rowing events.
The other is called `mens_gymnastics` and includes information about
medalists in all of the Gymnastics events.

-   Use the `ax.hist` method to add a histogram of the `"Weight"` column
    from the `mens_rowing` DataFrame.
-   Use `ax.hist` to add a histogram of `"Weight"` for the
    `mens_gymnastics` DataFrame.
-   Set the x-axis label to `"Weight (kg)"` and the y-axis label to
    `"# of observations"`.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
summer_2016_medals = pd.read_csv('summer2016.csv')
mens_rowing = summer_2016_medals[(summer_2016_medals['Sport'] == 'Rowing') & (summer_2016_medals['Sex'] == 'M')]
mens_gymnastics = summer_2016_medals[(summer_2016_medals['Sport'] == 'Gymnastics') & (summer_2016_medals['Sex'] == 'M')]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# Plot a histogram of "Weight" for mens_rowing
ax.hist(mens_rowing["Weight"])

# Compare to histogram of "Weight" for mens_gymnastics
ax.hist(mens_gymnastics["Weight"])

# Set the x-axis label to "Weight (kg)"
ax.set_xlabel("Weight (kg)")

# Set the y-axis label to "# of observations"
ax.set_ylabel("# of observations")

plt.show()
```

### "Step" histogram

Histograms allow us to see the distributions of the data in different
groups in our data. In this exercise, you will select groups from the
Summer 2016 Olympic Games medalist dataset to compare the height of
medalist athletes in two different sports.

The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame object called
`summer_2016_medals` that has a column "Height". In addition, you are
provided a pandas GroupBy object that has been grouped by the sport.

In this exercise, you will visualize and label the histograms of two
sports: "Gymnastics" and "Rowing" and see the marked difference between
medalists in these two sports.

-   Use the `hist` method to display a histogram of the `"Weight"`
    column from the `mens_rowing` DataFrame, label this as `"Rowing"`.
-   Use `hist` to display a histogram of the `"Weight"` column from the
    `mens_gymnastics` DataFrame, and label this as `"Gymnastics"`.
-   For both histograms, use the `histtype` argument to visualize the
    data using the `'step'` type and set the number of bins to use to 5.
-   Add a legend to the figure, before it is displayed.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot a histogram of "Weight" for mens_rowing
ax.hist(mens_rowing["Weight"], histtype='step', label="Rowing", bins=5)

# Compare to histogram of "Weight" for mens_gymnastics
ax.hist(mens_gymnastics["Weight"], histtype='step', label="Gymnastics", bins=5)

ax.set_xlabel("Weight (kg)")
ax.set_ylabel("# of observations")

# Add the legend and show the Figure
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Statistical plotting

### Adding error-bars to a bar chart

Statistical plotting techniques add quantitative information for
comparisons into the visualization. For example, in this exercise, we
will add error bars that quantify not only the difference in the means
of the height of medalists in the 2016 Olympic Games, but also the
standard deviation of each of these groups, as a way to assess whether
the difference is substantial relative to the variability within each
group.

For the purpose of this exercise, you will have two DataFrames:
`mens_rowing` holds data about the medalists in the rowing events and
`mens_gymnastics` will hold information about the medalists in the
gymnastics events.

-   Add a bar with size equal to the mean of the `"Height"` column in
    the `mens_rowing` DataFrame and an error-bar of its standard
    deviation.
-   Add another bar for the mean of the `"Height"` column in
    `mens_gymnastics` with an error-bar of its standard deviation.
-   Add a label to the the y-axis: `"Height (cm)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add a bar for the rowing "Height" column mean/std
ax.bar("Rowing", mens_rowing["Height"].mean(), yerr=mens_rowing["Height"].std())

# Add a bar for the gymnastics "Height" column mean/std
ax.bar("Gymnastics", mens_gymnastics["Height"].mean(), yerr=mens_gymnastics["Height"].std())

# Label the y-axis
ax.set_ylabel("Height (cm)")

plt.show()
```

### Adding error-bars to a plot

Adding error-bars to a plot is done by using the `errorbar` method of
the `Axes` object.

Here, you have two DataFrames loaded: `seattle_weather` has data about
the weather in Seattle and `austin_weather` has data about the weather
in Austin. Each DataFrame has a column `"MONTH"` that has the names of
the months, a column `"MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"` that has the average
temperature in each month and a column `"MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"` that has the
standard deviation of the temperatures across years.

In the exercise, you will plot the mean temperature across months and
add the standard deviation at each point as y errorbars.

-   Use the `ax.errorbar` method to add the Seattle data: the `"MONTH"`
    column as x values, the `"MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"` as y values and
    `"MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"` as `yerr` values.
-   Add the Austin data: the `"MONTH"` column as x values, the
    `"MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"` as y values and `"MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"` as `yerr`
    values.
-   Set the y-axis label as `"Temperature (Fahrenheit)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add the Seattle temperature data in each month with standard deviation error bars
ax.errorbar(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"], yerr=seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"])

# Add the Austin temperature data in each month with standard deviation error bars
ax.errorbar(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"], yerr=austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-STDDEV"])

# Set the y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Temperature (Fahrenheit)")

plt.show()
```

### Creating boxplots

Boxplots provide additional information about the distribution of the
data that they represent. They tell us what the median of the
distribution is, what the inter-quartile range is and also what the
expected range of approximately 99% of the data should be. Outliers
beyond this range are particularly highlighted.

In this exercise, you will use the data about medalist heights that you
previously visualized as histograms, and as bar charts with error bars,
and you will visualize it as boxplots.

Again, you will have the `mens_rowing` and `mens_gymnastics` DataFrames
available to you, and both of these DataFrames have columns called
`"Height"` that you will compare.

-   Create a boxplot that contains the `"Height"` column for
    `mens_rowing` on the left and `mens_gymnastics` on the right.
-   Add x-axis tick labels: `"Rowing"` and `"Gymnastics"`.
-   Add a y-axis label: `"Height (cm)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add a boxplot for the "Height" column in the DataFrames
ax.boxplot([mens_rowing["Height"], mens_gymnastics["Height"]])

# Add x-axis tick labels:
ax.set_xticklabels(["Rowing", "Gymnastics"])

# Add a y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel("Height (cm)")

plt.show()
```

## Quantitative comparisons: scatter plots

### Simple scatter plot

Scatter are a bi-variate visualization technique. They plot each record
in the data as a point. The location of each point is determined by the
value of two variables: the first variable determines the distance along
the x-axis and the second variable determines the height along the
y-axis.

In this exercise, you will create a scatter plot of the `climate_change`
data. This DataFrame, which is already loaded, has a column `"co2"` that
indicates the measurements of carbon dioxide every month and another
column, `"relative_temp"` that indicates the temperature measured at the
same time.

-   Using the `ax.scatter` method, add the data to the plot: `"co2"` on
    the x-axis and `"relative_temp"` on the y-axis.
-   Set the x-axis label to `"CO2 (ppm)"`.
-   Set the y-axis label to `"Relative temperature (C)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2" on x-axis, "relative_temp" on y-axis
ax.scatter(climate_change["co2"], climate_change["relative_temp"])

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")

plt.show()
```

### Encoding time by color

The screen only has two dimensions, but we can encode another dimension
in the scatter plot using color. Here, we will visualize the
`climate_change` dataset, plotting a scatter plot of the `"co2"` column,
on the x-axis, against the `"relative_temp"` column, on the y-axis. We
will encode time using the color dimension, with earlier times appearing
as darker shades of blue and later times appearing as brighter shades of
yellow.

-   Using the `ax.scatter` method add a scatter plot of the `"co2"`
    column (x-axis) against the `"relative_temp"` column.
-   Use the `c` key-word argument to pass in the index of the DataFrame
    as input to color each point according to its date.
-   Set the x-axis label to `"CO2 (ppm)"` and the y-axis label to
    `"Relative temperature (C)"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Add data: "co2", "relative_temp" as x-y, index as color
ax.scatter(climate_change["co2"], climate_change["relative_temp"], c=climate_change.index)

# Set the x-axis label to "CO2 (ppm)"
ax.set_xlabel("CO2 (ppm)")

# Set the y-axis label to "Relative temperature (C)"
ax.set_ylabel("Relative temperature (C)")

plt.show()
```

# Sharing visualizations with others

This chapter shows you how to share your visualizations with others: how to save your figures as files, how to adjust their look and feel, and how to automate their creation based on input data.

## Preparing your figures to share with others

### Selecting a style for printing

You are creating a figure that will be included in a leaflet printed on
a black-and-white printer. What style should you choose for your
figures?

In the console, we have loaded the medals dataset. Before initializing
Axes and Figure objects and plotting them, you can try setting a style
to use.

- [ ] `'seaborn-colorblind'`
- [x] `'grayscale'`
- [ ] `'tableau-colorblind10'`
- [ ] `'bmh'`

### Switching between styles

Selecting a style to use affects all of the visualizations that are
created after this style is selected.

Here, you will practice plotting data in two different styles. The data
you will use is the same weather data we used in the first lesson: you
will have available to you the DataFrame `seattle_weather` and the
DataFrame `austin_weather`, both with records of the average temperature
in every month.

Select the `'ggplot'` style, create a new Figure called `fig`, and a new
Axes object called `ax` with `plt.subplots`.

Select the `'Solarize_Light2'` style, create a new Figure called `fig`,
and a new Axes object called `ax` with `plt.subplots`.

```{python, eval=F}
# Use the "ggplot" style and create new Figure/Axes
plt.style.use('ggplot')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(seattle_weather["MONTH"], seattle_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()

# Use the "Solarize_Light2" style and create new Figure/Axes
plt.style.use('Solarize_Light2')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(austin_weather["MONTH"], austin_weather["MLY-TAVG-NORMAL"])
plt.show()
```

## Saving your visualizations


### Saving a file several times

If you want to share your visualizations with others, you will need to
save them into files. Matplotlib provides as way to do that, through the
`savefig` method of the `Figure` object. In this exercise, you will save
a figure several times. Each time setting the parameters to something
slightly different. We have provided and already created `Figure`
object.

Examine the figure by calling the `plt.show()` function.

Save the figure into the file `my_figure.png`, using the default
resolution.

Save the figure into the file `my_figure_300dpi.png` and set the
resolution to 300 dpi.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
plt.style.use('default')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(medals.index, medals['Gold'])
ax.set_xticklabels(medals.index, rotation=90)
ax.set_ylabel('Number of medals')

# Show the figure
plt.show()

# Save as a PNG file
fig.savefig('my_figure.png')

# Save as a PNG file with 300 dpi
fig.savefig('my_figure_300dpi.png', dpi=300)
```

### Save a figure with different sizes

Before saving your visualization, you might want to also set the size
that the figure will have on the page. To do so, you can use the
`Figure` object's `set_size_inches` method. This method takes a sequence
of two values. The first sets the width and the second sets the height
of the figure.

Here, you will again have a `Figure` object called `fig` already
provided (you can run `plt.show` if you want to see its contents). Use
the `Figure` methods `set_size_inches` and `savefig` to change its size
and save two different versions of this figure.

Set the figure size as width of 3 inches and height of 5 inches and save
it as `'figure_3_5.png'` with default resolution.

Set the figure size to width of 5 inches and height of 3 inches and save
it as `'figure_5_3.png'` with default settings.

```{python, eval=F}
# Set figure dimensions and save as a PNG
fig.set_size_inches([3, 5])
fig.savefig('figure_3_5.png')

# Set figure dimensions and save as a PNG
fig.set_size_inches([5, 3])
fig.savefig('figure_5_3.png')
```

## Automating figures from data

### Unique values of a column

One of the main strengths of Matplotlib is that it can be automated to
adapt to the data that it receives as input. For example, if you receive
data that has an unknown number of categories, you can still create a
bar plot that has bars for each category.

In this exercise and the next, you will be visualizing the weight of
athletes in the 2016 summer Olympic Games again, from a dataset that has
some unknown number of branches of sports in it. This will be loaded
into memory as a pandas `DataFrame` object called `summer_2016_medals`,
which has a column called `"Sport"` that tells you to which branch of
sport each row corresponds. There is also a `"Weight"` column that tells
you the weight of each athlete.

In this exercise, we will extract the unique values of the `"Sport"`
column

-   Create a variable called `sports_column` that holds the data from
    the `"Sport"` column of the `DataFrame` object.
-   Use the `unique` method of this variable to find all the unique
    different sports that are present in this data, and assign these
    values into a new variable called `sports`.
-   Print the `sports` variable to the console.

```{python, eval=F}
# Extract the "Sport" column
sports_column = summer_2016_medals["Sport"]

# Find the unique values of the "Sport" column
sports = sports_column.unique()

# Print out the unique sports values
print(sports)
```

### Automate your visualization

One of the main strengths of Matplotlib is that it can be automated to
adapt to the data that it receives as input. For example, if you receive
data that has an unknown number of categories, you can still create a
bar plot that has bars for each category.

This is what you will do in this exercise. You will be visualizing data
about medal winners in the 2016 summer Olympic Games again, but this
time you will have a dataset that has some unknown number of branches of
sports in it. This will be loaded into memory as a pandas `DataFrame`
object called `summer_2016_medals`, which has a column called `"Sport"`
that tells you to which branch of sport each row corresponds. There is
also a `"Weight"` column that tells you the weight of each athlete.

-   Iterate over the values of `sports` setting `sport` as your loop
    variable.
-   In each iteration, extract the rows where the `"Sport"` column is
    equal to `sport`.
-   Add a bar to the provided `ax` object, labeled with the sport name,
    with the mean of the `"Weight"` column as its height, and the
    standard deviation as a y-axis error bar.
-   Save the figure into the file `"sports_weights.png"`.

```{python, eval=F}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Loop over the different sports branches
for sport in sports:
  # Extract the rows only for this sport
  sport_df = summer_2016_medals[summer_2016_medals["Sport"] == sport]
  # Add a bar for the "Weight" mean with std y error bar
  ax.bar(sport, sport_df["Weight"].mean(), yerr=sport_df["Weight"].std())

ax.set_ylabel("Weight")
ax.set_xticklabels(sports, rotation=90)

# Save the figure to file
fig.savefig("sports_weights.png")
```

## Where to go next

### Where to go next

Congratulations! You have completed this introduction to Matplotlib. And yet, we have only scratched the surface in what Matplotlib can do.

### The Matplotlib gallery

One way to learn about other kinds of visualizations that you can create with Matplotlib is to visit the online gallery of examples on the Matplotlib website, at this URL.

### Gallery of examples

The gallery contains several dozen examples of figures that you can create with Matplotlib. If you click on one of the figures, you will land in a page

### Example page with code

that contains not only a larger version of the example, but also the full Python code that would generate this example from scratch. If you are interested in creating a visualization that is a variation on this example, you can start by copying over this example code and editing it to fit your particular use-case. This is much better than starting from scratch!

### Plotting data in 3D

Here are a few of the things that you might want to do next. In this course we always visualized data using the two dimensions of the page, but you can also extend your capability to visualize data, by adding perspective to your visualizations to make them appear three-dimensional. For example, here is a parametric curve through a three-dimensional space. In this web page, you can learn more about creating three-dimensional visualizations.

### Visualizing images with pseudo-color

Another capability of Matplotlib is visualizing data from images. For example, here is an image visualized using pseudo-color, where each value in the image is translated into a color. You can learn more about working with images in this URL.

### Animations

You might remember this visualization that I showed you in the very first lesson of this course. It used one more dimension, time, by varying the display through animation. You can create animations by creating multiple frames of the movie, each as its own visualization, and then stitching them together into a movie using tools such as Quicktime, but Matplotlib also has its own interface for creating animations. You can learn about this interface at this URL.

### Using Matplotlib for geospatial data

There are multiple software packages that extend Matplotlib's capability to a variety of different kinds of data. For example, Cartopy extends Matplotlib to be used with geospatial data, such as maps.

### pandas + Matplotlib = Seaborn

Another library that extends Matplotlib is Seaborn. This library creates very sophisticated statistical visualizations from pandas data structures, such as DataFrames. The nice thing about Seaborn is that you can create elegant and sophisticated visualizations of your data with very little code. For example, this code would create this visualization that encodes the fuel efficiency of cars as a function of their horsepower, but also encodes the country in which the car was manufactured, using the color of the bubbles, as well as their weight, using the size of each bubble.

### Seaborn example gallery

Seaborn also has an extensive example gallery that you can visit in this URL.

### Good luck visualizing your data!

So as you can see, there is a lot more to learn about data visualization. But thanks to this course, you have already taken your first step along the path to visualizing your data in Python, using Matplotlib. Good luck visualizing your data!
