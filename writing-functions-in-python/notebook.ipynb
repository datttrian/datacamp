    "You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!\n",

    "The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.\n",
