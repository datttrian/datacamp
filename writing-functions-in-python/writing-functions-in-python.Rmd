**Course Description**

You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!

# Best Practices

The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.

## Docstrings

### Crafting a docstring

You've decided to write the world's greatest open-source natural
language processing Python package. It will revolutionize working with
free-form text, the way `numpy` did for arrays, `pandas` did for tabular
data, and `scikit-learn` did for machine learning.

The first function you write is `count_letter()`. It takes a string and
a single letter and returns the number of times the letter appears in
the string. You want the users of your open-source package to be able to
understand how this function works easily, so you will need to give it a
docstring. Build up a Google Style docstring for this function by
following these steps.

-   Copy the following string and add it as the docstring for the
    function:
    `` Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`. ``

-   Now add the arguments section, using the Google style for docstrings. Use `str` to indicate a string.

-   Add a returns section that informs the user the return value is an `int`.

-   Finally, add some information about the `ValueError` that gets raised when the arguments aren't correct.

```{python, eval=F}
# Add a docstring to count_letter()
def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`."""
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  # Add a Google-style arguments section
  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.

  # Add a returns section
  Returns:
    int
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('"letter" must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.

  Returns:
    int

  # Add a section detailing what errors might be raised
  Raises:
    ValueError: If `letter` is not a one-character string.
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])
```

### Retrieving docstrings

You and a group of friends are working on building an amazing new Python
IDE (integrated development environment -- like PyCharm, Spyder,
Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.). The team wants to add a feature that
displays a tooltip with a function's docstring whenever the user starts
typing the function name. That way, the user doesn't have to go
elsewhere to look up the documentation for the function they are trying
to use. You've been asked to complete the `build_tooltip()` function
that retrieves a docstring from an arbitrary function.

You will be reusing the `count_letter()` function that you developed in
the last exercise to show that we can properly extract its docstring.

Begin by getting the docstring for the function `count_letter()`. Use an
attribute of the `count_letter()` function.

Now use a function from the `inspect` module to get a better-formatted
version of `count_letter()`'s docstring.

Now create a `build_tooltip()` function that can extract the docstring
from *any* function that we pass to it.

```{python, eval=F}
# Get the "count_letter" docstring by using an attribute of the function
docstring = count_letter.__doc__

border = '#' * 28
print('{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border))

import inspect

# Inspect the count_letter() function to get its docstring
docstring = inspect.getdoc(count_letter)

border = '#' * 28
print('{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border))

import inspect

def build_tooltip(function):
  """Create a tooltip for any function that shows the
  function's docstring.

  Args:
    function (callable): The function we want a tooltip for.

  Returns:
    str
  """
  # Get the docstring for the "function" argument by using inspect
  docstring = inspect.getdoc(function)
  border = '#' * 28
  return '{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border)

print(build_tooltip(count_letter))
print(build_tooltip(range))
print(build_tooltip(print))
```

### Docstrings to the rescue!

Some maniac has corrupted your installation of `numpy`! All of the
functions still exist, but they've been given random names. You
desperately need to call the `numpy.histogram()` function and you don't
have time to reinstall the package. Fortunately for you, the maniac
didn't think to alter the docstrings, and you know how to access them.
`numpy` has a lot of functions in it, so we've narrowed it down to four
possible functions that could be `numpy.histogram()` in disguise:
`numpy.leyud()`, `numpy.uqka()`, `numpy.fywdkxa()` or `numpy.jinzyxq()`.

Examine each of these functions' docstrings in the IPython shell to
determine which of them is actually `numpy.histogram()`.

- [ ] `numpy.leyud()`
- [ ] `numpy.uqka()`
- [x] `numpy.fywdkxa()`
- [ ] `numpy.jinzyxq()`

## DRY and "Do One Thing"

### Extract a function

While you were developing a model to predict the likelihood of a student
graduating from college, you wrote this bit of code to get the z-scores
of students' yearly GPAs. Now you're ready to turn it into a
production-quality system, so you need to do something about the
repetition. Writing a function to calculate the z-scores would improve
this code.

    # Standardize the GPAs for each year
    df['y1_z'] = (df.y1_gpa - df.y1_gpa.mean()) / df.y1_gpa.std()
    df['y2_z'] = (df.y2_gpa - df.y2_gpa.mean()) / df.y2_gpa.std()
    df['y3_z'] = (df.y3_gpa - df.y3_gpa.mean()) / df.y3_gpa.std()
    df['y4_z'] = (df.y4_gpa - df.y4_gpa.mean()) / df.y4_gpa.std()

*Note: `df` is a pandas DataFrame where each row is a student with 4
columns of yearly student GPAs: `y1_gpa`, `y2_gpa`, `y3_gpa`, `y4_gpa`*

-   Finish the function so that it returns the z-scores of a column.
-   Use the function to calculate the z-scores for each year
    (`df['y1_z']`, `df['y2_z']`, etc.) from the raw GPA scores
    (`df.y1_gpa`, `df.y2_gpa`, etc.).

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("students.csv")

def standardize(column):
  """Standardize the values in a column.

  Args:
    column (pandas Series): The data to standardize.

  Returns:
    pandas Series: the values as z-scores
  """
  # Finish the function so that it returns the z-scores
  z_score = (column - column.mean()) / column.std()
  return z_score

# Use the standardize() function to calculate the z-scores
df['y1_z'] = standardize(df.y1_gpa)
df['y2_z'] = standardize(df.y2_gpa)
df['y3_z'] = standardize(df.y3_gpa)
df['y4_z'] = standardize(df.y4_gpa)
```

### Split up a function

Another engineer on your team has written this function to calculate the
mean and median of a sorted list. You want to show them how to split it
into two simpler functions: `mean()` and `median()`

    def mean_and_median(values):
      """Get the mean and median of a sorted list of `values`

      Args:
        values (iterable of float): A list of numbers

      Returns:
        tuple (float, float): The mean and median
      """
      mean = sum(values) / len(values)
      midpoint = int(len(values) / 2)
      if len(values) % 2 == 0:
        median = (values[midpoint - 1] + values[midpoint]) / 2
      else:
        median = values[midpoint]

      return mean, median

Write the `mean()` function.

Write the `median()` function.

```{python, eval=F}
def mean(values):
  """Get the mean of a sorted list of values

  Args:
    values (iterable of float): A list of numbers

  Returns:
    float
  """
  # Write the mean() function
  mean = sum(values) / len(values)
  return mean

def median(values):
  """Get the median of a sorted list of values

  Args:
    values (iterable of float): A list of numbers

  Returns:
    float
  """
  # Write the median() function
  midpoint = int(len(values) / 2)
  if len(values) % 2 == 0:
    median = (values[midpoint - 1] + values[midpoint]) / 2
  else:
    median = values[midpoint]
  return median
```

## Pass by assignment

### Mutable or immutable?

The following function adds a mapping between a string and the lowercase
version of that string to a dictionary. What do you expect the values of
`d` and `s` to be after the function is called?

    def store_lower(_dict, _string):
      """Add a mapping between `_string` and a lowercased version of `_string` to `_dict`

      Args:
        _dict (dict): The dictionary to update.
        _string (str): The string to add.
      """
      orig_string = _string
      _string = _string.lower()
      _dict[orig_string] = _string

    d = {}
    s = 'Hello'

    store_lower(d, s)

- [ ] `d = {}`, `s = 'Hello'`
- [ ] `d = {}`, `s = 'hello'`
- [x] `d = {'Hello': 'hello'}`, `s = 'Hello'`
- [ ] `d = {'Hello': 'hello'}`, `s = 'hello'`
- [ ] `d = {'hello': 'hello'}`, `s = 'hello'`

### Best practice for default arguments

One of your co-workers (who obviously didn't take this course) has
written this function for adding a column to a pandas DataFrame.
Unfortunately, they used a mutable variable as a default argument value!
Please show them a better way to do this so that they don't get
unexpected behavior.

    def add_column(values, df=pandas.DataFrame()):
      """Add a column of `values` to a DataFrame `df`.
      The column will be named "col_<n>" where "n" is
      the numerical index of the column.

      Args:
        values (iterable): The values of the new column
        df (DataFrame, optional): The DataFrame to update.
          If no DataFrame is passed, one is created by default.

      Returns:
        DataFrame
      """
      df['col_{}'.format(len(df.columns))] = values
      return df

-   Change the default value of `df` to an immutable value to follow
    best practices.
-   Update the code of the function so that a new DataFrame is created
    if the caller didn't pass one.

```{python, eval=F}
# Use an immutable variable for the default argument
def better_add_column(values, df=None):
  """Add a column of `values` to a DataFrame `df`.
  The column will be named "col_<n>" where "n" is
  the numerical index of the column.

  Args:
    values (iterable): The values of the new column
    df (DataFrame, optional): The DataFrame to update.
      If no DataFrame is passed, one is created by default.

  Returns:
    DataFrame
  """
  # Update the function to create a default DataFrame
  if df is None:
    df = pandas.DataFrame()
  df['col_{}'.format(len(df.columns))] = values
  return df
```

# Context Managers

If you've ever seen the "with" keyword in Python and wondered what its deal was, then this is the chapter for you! Context managers are a convenient way to provide connections in Python and guarantee that those connections get cleaned up when you are done using them. This chapter will show you how to use context managers, as well as how to write your own.

## Using context managers

### The number of cats

You are working on a natural language processing project to determine
what makes great writers so great. Your current hypothesis is that great
writers talk about cats *a lot*. To prove it, you want to count the
number of times the word "cat" appears in "Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. You have already downloaded a text file,
`alice.txt`, with the entire contents of this great book.

-   Use the `open()` context manager to open `alice.txt` and assign the
    file to the `file` variable.

```{python, eval=F}
# Open "alice.txt" and assign the file to "file"
with open('alice.txt') as file:
  text = file.read()

n = 0
for word in text.split():
  if word.lower() in ['cat', 'cats']:
    n += 1

print('Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" {} times'.format(n))
```

### The speed of cats

You're working on a new web service that processes Instagram feeds to
identify which pictures contain cats (don't ask why -- it's the
internet). The code that processes the data is slower than you would
like it to be, so you are working on tuning it up to run faster. Given
an image, `image`, you have two functions that can process it:

-   `process_with_numpy(image)`
-   `process_with_pytorch(image)`

Your colleague wrote a context manager, `timer()`, that will print out
how long the code inside the context block takes to run. She is
suggesting you use it to see which of the two options is faster. Time
each function to determine which one to use in your web service.

-   Use the `timer()` context manager to time how long
    `process_with_numpy(image)` takes to run.
-   Use the `timer()` context manager to time how long
    `process_with_pytorch(image)` takes to run.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import numpy as np
import time
import contextlib
def get_image_from_instagram():
  return np.random.rand(84, 84)
def _process_pic(n_sec):
  print('Processing', end='', flush=True)
  for i in range(10):
    print('.', end='' if i < 9 else 'done!\n', flush=True)
    time.sleep(n_sec)
def process_with_pytorch(p):
  _process_pic(0.0328)
def process_with_numpy(p):
  _process_pic(0.1521)
@contextlib.contextmanager
def timer():
  """Time how long code in the context block takes to run."""
  t0 = time.time()
  try:
      yield
  except:
    raise
  finally:
    t1 = time.time()
    print('Elapsed: {:.2f} seconds'.format(t1 - t0))

image = get_image_from_instagram()

# Time how long process_with_numpy(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Numpy version')
  process_with_numpy(image)

# Time how long process_with_pytorch(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Pytorch version')
  process_with_pytorch(image)
```

## Writing context managers

### The timer() context manager

A colleague of yours is working on a web service that processes
Instagram photos. Customers are complaining that the service takes too
long to identify whether or not an image has a cat in it, so your
colleague has come to you for help. You decide to write a context
manager that they can use to time how long their functions take to run.

-   Add a decorator from the `contextlib` module to the `timer()`
    function that will make it act like a context manager.
-   Send control from the `timer()` function to the context block.

```{python, eval=F}
# Add a decorator that will make timer() a context manager
@contextlib.contextmanager
def timer():
  """Time the execution of a context block.

  Yields:
    None
  """
  start = time.time()
  # Send control back to the context block
  yield
  end = time.time()
  print('Elapsed: {:.2f}s'.format(end - start))

with timer():
  print('This should take approximately 0.25 seconds')
  time.sleep(0.25)
```

### A read-only open() context manager

You have a bunch of data files for your next deep learning project that
took you months to collect and clean. It would be *terrible* if you
accidentally overwrote one of those files when trying to read it in for
training, so you decide to create a read-only version of the `open()`
context manager to use in your project.

The regular `open()` context manager:

-   takes a filename and a mode (`'r'` for read, `'w'` for write, or
    `'a'` for append)
-   opens the file for reading, writing, or appending
-   yields control back to the context, along with a reference to the
    file
-   waits for the context to finish
-   and then closes the file before exiting

Your context manager will do the same thing, except it will *only* take
the filename as an argument and it will only open the file for reading.

-   Yield control from `open_read_only()` to the context block, ensuring
    that the `read_only_file` object gets assigned to `my_file`.
-   Use `read_only_file`'s `.close()` method to ensure that you don't
    leave open files lying around.

```{python, eval=F}
@contextlib.contextmanager
def open_read_only(filename):
  """Open a file in read-only mode.

  Args:
    filename (str): The location of the file to read

  Yields:
    file object
  """
  read_only_file = open(filename, mode='r')
  # Yield read_only_file so it can be assigned to my_file
  yield read_only_file
  # Close read_only_file
  read_only_file.close()

with open_read_only('my_file.txt') as my_file:
  print(my_file.read())
```

## Advanced topics

## Context manager use cases

Which of the following would **NOT** be a good opportunity to use a
context manager?

- [ ] A function that starts a timer that keeps track of how long some
    block of code takes to run.
- [x] A function that prints all of the prime numbers between 2 and some
    value `n`.
- [ ] A function that connects to a smart thermostat so that it can be
    programmed remotely.
- [ ] A function that prevents multiple users from updating an online
    spreadsheet at the same time by locking access to the spreadsheet
    before every operation.

### Scraping the NASDAQ

Training deep neural nets is expensive! You might as well invest in
NVIDIA stock since you're spending so much on GPUs. To pick the best
time to invest, you are going to collect and analyze some data on how
their stock is doing. The context manager `stock('NVDA')` will connect
to the NASDAQ and return an object that you can use to get the latest
price by calling its `.price()` method.

You want to connect to `stock('NVDA')` and record 10 timesteps of price
data by writing it to the file `NVDA.txt`.

You will notice the use of an underscore when iterating over the for
loop. If this is confusing to you, don't worry. It could easily be
replaced with `i`, if we planned to do something with it, like use it as
an index. Since we won't be using it, we can use a dummy operator, `_`,
which doesn't use any additional memory.

-   Use the `stock('NVDA')` context manager and assign the result to
    `nvda`.
-   Open a file for writing with `open('NVDA.txt', 'w')` and assign the
    file object to `f_out` so you can record the price over time.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
class MockStock:
    def __init__(self, loc, scale):
        self.loc = loc
        self.scale = scale
        self.recent = list(np.random.laplace(loc, scale, 2))
    def price(self):
        sign = np.sign(self.recent[1] - self.recent[0])
        # 70% chance of going same direction
        sign = 1 if sign == 0 else (sign if np.random.rand() > 0.3 else -1 * sign)
        new = self.recent[1] + sign * np.random.rand() / 10.0
        self.recent = [self.recent[1], new]
        return new
@contextlib.contextmanager
def stock(symbol):
    base = 140.00
    scale = 1.0
    mock = MockStock(base, scale)
    print('Opening stock ticker for {}'.format(symbol))
    yield mock
    print('Closing stock ticker')

# Use the "stock('NVDA')" context manager
# and assign the result to the variable "nvda"
with stock('NVDA') as nvda:
  # Open 'NVDA.txt' for writing as f_out
  with open('NVDA.txt', 'w') as f_out:
    for _ in range(10):
      value = nvda.price()
      print('Logging ${:.2f} for NVDA'.format(value))
      f_out.write('{:.2f}\n'.format(value))
```

### Changing the working directory

You are using an open-source library that lets you train deep neural
networks on your data. Unfortunately, during training, this library
writes out checkpoint models (i.e., models that have been trained on a
portion of the data) to the current working directory. You find that
behavior frustrating because you don't want to have to launch the script
from the directory where the models will be saved.

You decide that one way to fix this is to write a context manager that
changes the current working directory, lets you build your models, and
then resets the working directory to its original location. You'll want
to be sure that any errors that occur during model training don't
prevent you from resetting the working directory to its original
location.

-   Add a statement that lets you handle any errors that might occur
    inside the context.
-   Add a statement that ensures `os.chdir(current_dir)` will be called,
    whether there was an error or not.

```{python, eval=F}
def in_dir(directory):
  """Change current working directory to `directory`,
  allow the user to run some code, and change back.

  Args:
    directory (str): The path to a directory to work in.
  """
  current_dir = os.getcwd()
  os.chdir(directory)

  # Add code that lets you handle errors
  try:
    yield
  # Ensure the directory is reset,
  # whether there was an error or not
  finally:
    os.chdir(current_dir)
```

# Decorators

Decorators are an extremely powerful concept in Python. They allow you to modify the behavior of a function without changing the code of the function itself. This chapter will lay the foundational concepts needed to thoroughly understand decorators (functions as objects, scope, and closures), and give you a good introduction into how decorators are used and defined. This deep dive into Python internals will set you up to be a superstar Pythonista.

## Functions are objects

### Building a command line data app

You are building a command line tool that lets a user interactively
explore a dataset. We've defined four functions: `mean()`, `std()`,
`minimum()`, and `maximum()` that users can call to analyze their data.
Help finish this section of the code so that your users can call any of
these functions by typing the function name at the input prompt.

**Note**: The function `get_user_input()` in this exercise is a mock
version of asking the user to enter a command. It randomly returns one
of the four function names. In real life, you would ask for input and
wait until the user entered a value.

-   Add the functions `std()`, `minimum()`, and `maximum()` to the
    `function_map` dictionary, like we did with `mean()`.
-   The name of the function the user wants to call is stored in
    `func_name`. Use the dictionary of functions, `function_map`, to
    call the chosen function and pass `data` as an argument.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
import random
def get_user_input(prompt='Type a command: '):
    command = random.choice(['mean', 'std', 'minimum', 'maximum'])
    print(prompt)
    print('> {}'.format(command))
    return command
def mean(data):
    print(data.mean())
def std(data):
    print(data.std())
def minimum(data):
    print(data.min())
def maximum(data):
    print(data.max())
def load_data():
    df = pd.DataFrame()
    df['height'] = [72.1, 69.8, 63.2, 64.7]
    df['weight'] = [198, 204, 164, 238]
    return df

# Add the missing function references to the function map
function_map = {
  'mean': mean,
  'std': std,
  'minimum': minimum,
  'maximum': maximum
}

data = load_data()
print(data)

func_name = get_user_input()

# Call the chosen function and pass "data" as an argument
function_map[func_name](data)
```

### Reviewing your co-worker's code

Your co-worker is asking you to review some code that they've written
and give them some tips on how to get it ready for production. You know
that having a docstring is considered best practice for maintainable,
reusable functions, so as a sanity check you decide to run this
`has_docstring()` function on all of their functions.

    def has_docstring(func):
      """Check to see if the function 
      `func` has a docstring.

      Args:
        func (callable): A function.

      Returns:
        bool
      """
      return func.__doc__ is not None

### Returning functions for a math game

You are building an educational math game where the player enters a math
term, and your program returns a function that matches that term. For
instance, if the user types "add", your program returns a function that
adds two numbers. So far you've only implemented the "add" function. Now
you want to include a "subtract" function.

-   Define the `subtract()` function. It should take two arguments and
    return the first argument minus the second argument.

```{python, eval=F}
def create_math_function(func_name):
  if func_name == 'add':
    def add(a, b):
      return a + b
    return add
  elif func_name == 'subtract':
    # Define the subtract() function
    def subtract(a, b):
      return a - b
    return subtract
  else:
    print("I don't know that one")
    
add = create_math_function('add')
print('5 + 2 = {}'.format(add(5, 2)))

subtract = create_math_function('subtract')
print('5 - 2 = {}'.format(subtract(5, 2)))
```

## Scope

### Understanding scope

What four values does this script print?

    x = 50

    def one():
      x = 10

    def two():
      global x
      x = 30

    def three():
      x = 100
      print(x)

    for func in [one, two, three]:
      func()
      print(x)

- [ ] 50, 30, 100, 50
- [ ] 10, 30, 30, 30
- [x] 50, 30, 100, 30
- [ ] 10, 30, 100, 50
- [ ] 50, 50, 50, 50

### Modifying variables outside local scope

Sometimes your functions will need to modify a variable that is outside
of the local scope of that function. While it's generally not best
practice to do so, it's still good to know how in case you need to do
it. Update these functions so they can modify variables that would
usually be outside of their scope.

Add a keyword that lets us update `call_count` from inside the function.

Add a keyword that lets us modify `file_contents` from inside
`save_contents()`.

Add a keyword to `done` in `check_is_done()` so that `wait_until_done()`
eventually stops looping.

```{python, eval=F}
call_count = 0

def my_function():
  # Use a keyword that lets us update call_count 
  global call_count
  call_count += 1
  
  print("You've called my_function() {} times!".format(
    call_count
  ))
  
for _ in range(20):
  my_function()
  
def read_files():
  file_contents = None
  
  def save_contents(filename):
    # Add a keyword that lets us modify file_contents
    nonlocal file_contents
    if file_contents is None:
      file_contents = []
    with open(filename) as fin:
      file_contents.append(fin.read())
      
  for filename in ['1984.txt', 'MobyDick.txt', 'CatsEye.txt']:
    save_contents(filename)
    
  return file_contents

print('\n'.join(read_files()))

def wait_until_done():
  def check_is_done():
    # Add a keyword so that wait_until_done() 
    # doesn't run forever
    global done
    if random.random() < 0.1:
      done = True
      
  while not done:
    check_is_done()

done = False
wait_until_done()

print('Work done? {}'.format(done))
```

## Closures

### Checking for closure

You're teaching your niece how to program in Python, and she is working
on returning nested functions. She thinks she has written the code
correctly, but she is worried that the returned function won't have the
necessary information when called. Show her that all of the nonlocal
variables she needs are in the new function's closure.

-   Use an attribute of the `my_func()` function to show that it has a
    closure that is not `None`.

-   Show that there are two variables in the closure.

-   Get the values of the variables in the closure so you can show that they are equal to `[2, 17]`, the arguments passed to `return_a_func()`.


```{python, eval=F}
def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

# Show that my_func()'s closure is not None
print(my_func.__closure__ is not None)

def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

print(my_func.__closure__ is not None)

# Show that there are two variables in the closure
print(len(my_func.__closure__) == 2)

def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

print(my_func.__closure__ is not None)
print(len(my_func.__closure__) == 2)

# Get the values of the variables in the closure
closure_values = [
  my_func.__closure__[i].cell_contents for i in range(2)
]
print(closure_values == [2, 17])
```

### Closures keep your values safe

You are still helping your niece understand closures. You have written
the function `get_new_func()` that returns a nested function. The nested
function `call_func()` calls whatever function was passed to
`get_new_func()`. You've also written `my_special_function()` which
simply prints a message that states that you are executing
`my_special_function()`.

You want to show your niece that no matter what you do to
`my_special_function()` after passing it to `get_new_func()`, the new
function still mimics the behavior of the original
`my_special_function()` because it is in the new function's closure.

Show that you still get the original message even if you redefine
`my_special_function()` to only print "hello".

Show that even if you delete `my_special_function()`, you can still call
`new_func()` without any problems.

Show that you still get the original message even if you overwrite
`my_special_function()` with the new function.

```{python, eval=F}
def my_special_function():
  print('You are running my_special_function()')
  
def get_new_func(func):
  def call_func():
    func()
  return call_func

new_func = get_new_func(my_special_function)

# Redefine my_special_function() to just print "hello"
def my_special_function():
  print("hello")

new_func()

def my_special_function():
  print('You are running my_special_function()')
  
def get_new_func(func):
  def call_func():
    func()
  return call_func

new_func = get_new_func(my_special_function)

# Delete my_special_function()
del(my_special_function)

new_func()

def my_special_function():
  print('You are running my_special_function()')
  
def get_new_func(func):
  def call_func():
    func()
  return call_func

# Overwrite `my_special_function` with the new function
my_special_function = get_new_func(my_special_function)

my_special_function()
```

## Decorators

### Using decorator syntax

You have written a decorator called `print_args` that prints out all of
the arguments and their values any time a function that it is decorating
gets called.

Decorate `my_function()` with the `print_args()` decorator by redefining
the `my_function` variable.

Decorate `my_function()` with the `print_args()` decorator using
decorator syntax.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
def print_args(func):
    sig = inspect.signature(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        bound = sig.bind(*args, **kwargs).arguments
        str_args = ', '.join(['{}={}'.format(k, v) for k, v in bound.items()])
        print('{} was called with {}'.format(func.__name__, str_args))
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

def my_function(a, b, c):
  print(a + b + c)

# Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator
my_function = print_args(my_function)

my_function(1, 2, 3)

# Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator
@print_args
def my_function(a, b, c):
  print(a + b + c)

my_function(1, 2, 3)
```

### Defining a decorator

Your buddy has been working on a decorator that prints a "before"
message before the decorated function is called and prints an "after"
message after the decorated function is called. They are having trouble
remembering how wrapping the decorated function is supposed to work.
Help them out by finishing their `print_before_and_after()` decorator.

-   Call the function being decorated and pass it the positional
    arguments `*args`.
-   Return the new decorated function.

```{python, eval=F}
def print_before_and_after(func):
  def wrapper(*args):
    print('Before {}'.format(func.__name__))
    # Call the function being decorated with *args
    func(*args)
    print('After {}'.format(func.__name__))
  # Return the nested function
  return wrapper

@print_before_and_after
def multiply(a, b):
  print(a * b)

multiply(5, 10)
```

# More on Decorators

Now that you understand how decorators work under the hood, this chapter gives you a bunch of real-world examples of when and how you would write decorators in your own code. You will also learn advanced decorator concepts like how to preserve the metadata of your decorated functions and how to write decorators that take arguments.

## Real-world examples

### Print the return type

You are debugging a package that you've been working on with your
friends. Something weird is happening with the data being returned from
one of your functions, but you're not even sure which function is
causing the trouble. You know that sometimes bugs can sneak into your
code when you are expecting a function to return one thing, and it
returns something different. For instance, if you expect a function to
return a numpy array, but it returns a list, you can get unexpected
behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide
to write a decorator, `print_return_type()`, that will print out the
type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function
it is decorating.

-   Create a nested function, `wrapper()`, that will become the new
    decorated function.
-   Call the function being decorated.
-   Return the new decorated function.

```{python, eval=F}
def print_return_type(func):
  # Define wrapper(), the decorated function
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    # Call the function being decorated
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    print('{}() returned type {}'.format(
      func.__name__, type(result)
    ))
    return result
  # Return the decorated function
  return wrapper
  
@print_return_type
def foo(value):
  return value
  
print(foo(42))
print(foo([1, 2, 3]))
print(foo({'a': 42}))
```

### Counter

You're working on a new web app, and you are curious about how many
times each of the functions in it gets called. So you decide to write a
decorator that adds a counter to each function that you decorate. You
could use this information in the future to determine whether there are
sections of code that you could remove because they are no longer being
used by the app.

-   Call the function being decorated and return the result.
-   Return the new decorated function.
-   Decorate `foo()` with the `counter()` decorator.

```{python, eval=F}
def counter(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    wrapper.count += 1
    # Call the function being decorated and return the result
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  wrapper.count = 0
  # Return the new decorated function
  return wrapper

# Decorate foo() with the counter() decorator
@counter
def foo():
  print('calling foo()')
  
foo()
foo()

print('foo() was called {} times.'.format(foo.count))
```

## Decorators and metadata

### Preserving docstrings when decorating functions

Your friend has come to you with a problem. They've written some nifty
decorators and added them to the functions in the open-source library
they've been working on. However, they were running some tests and
discovered that all of the docstrings have mysteriously disappeared from
their decorated functions. Show your friend how to preserve docstrings
and other metadata when writing decorators.

-   Decorate `print_sum()` with the `add_hello()` decorator to replicate
    the issue that your friend saw - that the docstring disappears.

<!-- -->

-   To show your friend that they are printing the `wrapper()`
    function's docstring, not the `print_sum()` docstring, add the
    following docstring to `wrapper()`:

<!-- -->

    """Print 'hello' and then call the decorated function."""

-   Import a function that will allow you to add the metadata from
    `print_sum()` to the decorated version of `print_sum()`.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, decorate `wrapper()` so that the metadata from `func()` is
    preserved in the new decorated function.

```{python, eval=F}
def add_hello(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    print('Hello')
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper

# Decorate print_sum() with the add_hello() decorator
@add_hello
def print_sum(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers and prints the sum"""
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(10, 20)
print_sum_docstring = print_sum.__doc__
print(print_sum_docstring)

def add_hello(func):
  # Add a docstring to wrapper
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    """Print 'hello' and then call the decorated function."""
    print('Hello')
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper

@add_hello
def print_sum(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers and prints the sum"""
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(10, 20)
print_sum_docstring = print_sum.__doc__
print(print_sum_docstring)

# Import the function you need to fix the problem
from functools import wraps

def add_hello(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    """Print 'hello' and then call the decorated function."""
    print('Hello')
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper
  
@add_hello
def print_sum(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers and prints the sum"""
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(10, 20)
print_sum_docstring = print_sum.__doc__
print(print_sum_docstring)

from functools import wraps

def add_hello(func):
  # Decorate wrapper() so that it keeps func()'s metadata
  @wraps(func)
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    """Print 'hello' and then call the decorated function."""
    print('Hello')
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
  return wrapper
  
@add_hello
def print_sum(a, b):
  """Adds two numbers and prints the sum"""
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(10, 20)
print_sum_docstring = print_sum.__doc__
print(print_sum_docstring)
```

### Measuring decorator overhead

Your boss wrote a decorator called `check_everything()` that they think
is amazing, and they are insisting you use it on your function. However,
you've noticed that when you use it to decorate your functions, it makes
them run *much* slower. You need to convince your boss that the
decorator is adding too much processing time to your function. To do
this, you are going to measure how long the decorated function takes to
run and compare it to how long the undecorated function would have taken
to run. This is the decorator in question:

    def check_everything(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        check_inputs(*args, **kwargs)
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        check_outputs(result)
        return result
      return wrapper

-   Call the original function instead of the decorated version by using
    an attribute of the function that the `wraps()` statement in your
    boss's decorator added to the decorated function.

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
def check_inputs(a, *args, **kwargs):
  for value in a:
    time.sleep(0.01)
  print('Finished checking inputs')
def check_outputs(a, *args, **kwargs):
  for value in a:
    time.sleep(0.01)
  print('Finished checking outputs')
def check_everything(func):
  @wraps(func)
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    check_inputs(*args, **kwargs)
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    check_outputs(result)
    return result
  return wrapper

@check_everything
def duplicate(my_list):
  """Return a new list that repeats the input twice"""
  return my_list + my_list

t_start = time.time()
duplicated_list = duplicate(list(range(50)))
t_end = time.time()
decorated_time = t_end - t_start

t_start = time.time()
# Call the original function instead of the decorated one
duplicated_list = duplicate.__wrapped__(list(range(50)))
t_end = time.time()
undecorated_time = t_end - t_start

print('Decorated time: {:.5f}s'.format(decorated_time))
print('Undecorated time: {:.5f}s'.format(undecorated_time))
```

## Decorators that take arguments

### Run_n_times()

In the video exercise, I showed you an example of a decorator that takes
an argument: `run_n_times()`. The code for that decorator is repeated
below to remind you how it works. Practice different ways of applying
the decorator to the function `print_sum()`. Then I'll show you a funny
prank you can play on your co-workers.

    def run_n_times(n):
      """Define and return a decorator"""
      def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
          for i in range(n):
            func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
      return decorator

Add the `run_n_times()` decorator to `print_sum()` using decorator
syntax so that `print_sum()` runs 10 times.

Use `run_n_times()` to create a decorator `run_five_times()` that will
run any function five times.

Here's the prank: use `run_n_times()` to modify the built-in `print()`
function so that it always prints 20 times!

```{python, eval=F}
# edited/added
def run_n_times(n):
  """Define and return a decorator"""
  def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
      for i in range(n):
        func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
  return decorator

# Make print_sum() run 10 times with the run_n_times() decorator
@run_n_times(10)
def print_sum(a, b):
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(15, 20)

# Use run_n_times() to create the run_five_times() decorator
run_five_times = run_n_times(5)

@run_five_times
def print_sum(a, b):
  print(a + b)
  
print_sum(4, 100)

# Modify the print() function to always run 20 times
print = run_n_times(20)(print)

print('What is happening?!?!')
```

### HTML Generator

You are writing a script that generates HTML for a webpage on the fly.
So far, you have written two decorators that will add bold or italics
tags to any function that returns a string. You notice, however, that
these two decorators look very similar. Instead of writing a bunch of
other similar looking decorators, you want to create one decorator,
`html()`, that can take any pair of opening and closing tags.

    def bold(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        msg = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return '<b>{}</b>'.format(msg)
      return wrapper

    def italics(func):
      @wraps(func)
      def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        msg = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return '<i>{}</i>'.format(msg)
      return wrapper

Return the decorator and the decorated function from the correct places
in the new `html()` decorator.

Use the `html()` decorator to wrap the return value of `hello()` in the
strings `<b>` and `</b>` (the HTML tags that mean "bold").

Use `html()` to wrap the return value of `goodbye()` in the strings
`<i>` and `</i>` (the HTML tags that mean "italics").

Use `html()` to wrap `hello_goodbye()` in a DIV, which is done by adding
the strings `<div>` and `</div>` tags around a string.

```{python, eval=F}
def html(open_tag, close_tag):
  def decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
      msg = func(*args, **kwargs)
      return '{}{}{}'.format(open_tag, msg, close_tag)
    # Return the decorated function
    return wrapper
  # Return the decorator
  return decorator

# Make hello() return bolded text
@html('<b>', '</b>')
def hello(name):
  return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)

print(hello('Alice'))

# Make goodbye() return italicized text
@html('<i>', '</i>')
def goodbye(name):
  return 'Goodbye {}.'.format(name)
  
print(goodbye('Alice'))

# Wrap the result of hello_goodbye() in <div> and </div>
@html('<div>', '</div>')
def hello_goodbye(name):
  return '\n{}\n{}\n'.format(hello(name), goodbye(name))
  
print(hello_goodbye('Alice'))
```

## Timeout(): a real world example

### Tag your functions

Tagging something means that you have given that thing one or more
strings that act as labels. For instance, we often tag emails or photos
so that we can search for them later. You've decided to write a
decorator that will let you tag your functions with an arbitrary list of
tags. You could use these tags for many things:

-   Adding information about who has worked on the function, so a user
    can look up who to ask if they run into trouble using it.
-   Labeling functions as "experimental" so that users know that the
    inputs and outputs might change in the future.
-   Marking any functions that you plan to remove in a future version of
    the code.
-   Etc.

<!-- -->

-   Define a new decorator, named `decorator()`, to return.
-   Ensure the decorated function keeps its metadata.
-   Call the function being decorated and return the result.
-   Return the new decorator.

```{python, eval=F}
def tag(*tags):
  # Define a new decorator, named "decorator", to return
  def decorator(func):
    # Ensure the decorated function keeps its metadata
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
      # Call the function being decorated and return the result
      return func(*args, **kwargs)
    wrapper.tags = tags
    return wrapper
  # Return the new decorator
  return decorator

@tag('test', 'this is a tag')
def foo():
  pass

print(foo.tags)
```

### Check the return type

Python's flexibility around data types is usually cited as one of the
benefits of the language. It can sometimes cause problems though if
incorrect data types go unnoticed. You've decided that in order to
ensure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will
explicitly check the return types in all of your functions and make sure
they're returning what you expect. To do that, you are going to create a
decorator that checks if the return type of the decorated function is
correct.

*Note*: `assert` is a keyword that you can use to test whether something
is true. If you type `assert condition` and `condition` is `True`, this
function doesn't do anything. If `condition` is `False`, this function
raises an error. The type of error that it raises is called an
`AssertionError`.

-   Start by completing the `returns_dict()` decorator so that it raises
    an `AssertionError` if the return type of the decorated function is
    not a dictionary.

-   Now complete the `returns()` decorator, which takes the expected return type as an argument.


```{python, eval=F}
def returns_dict(func):
  # Complete the returns_dict() decorator
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    assert type(result) == dict
    return result
  return wrapper

@returns_dict
def foo(value):
  return value

try:
  print(foo([1,2,3]))
except AssertionError:
  print('foo() did not return a dict!')

## Great job!

### Great job!

Great job! You've covered a lot in this course.

### Chapter 1 - Best Practices

In the first chapter, you learned how to make high-quality functions by giving them docstrings and by making sure that they only do one thing. Remembering the acronym DRY, or "Don't Repeat Yourself", helped you notice when you needed to pull part of your code into a reusable function. You also learned about how Python passes arguments to functions and the difference between mutable and immutable variables.

### Chapter 2 - Context Managers

In the chapter on context managers, you learned how to use the keyword "with" to enter and then exit a context. You also learned how to write your own context managers by using the contextmanager() decorator.

### Chapter 3 - Decorators

You also spent a lot of time in this course understanding decorators: how they work, how to use them, and how to write decorators of your own.

### Chapter 4 - More on Decorators

Finally, in chapter 4, you learned how to use functools.wraps() to make sure your decorated functions maintain their metadata.

### Chapter 4 - More on Decorators

And you learned how to write decorators that take arguments.

### Thank you!

It has been an honor to spend this time with you. I wanted to let you know that I'll be donating a portion of the proceeds from this course to WiMLDS, a non-profit that helps support and promote women in the fields of machine learning and data science. I'll be looking forward to hearing about all of the amazing things you do with Python in the future!
